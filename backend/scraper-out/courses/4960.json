In this course, we learn the definition of environmental (in)justice; the history of environmental justice; and also examples of environmental justice will be discussed. We will learn about environmental movements. This course has a critical perspective on health disparities in national and international levels. How environmental injustice impacts certain groups more than others and the social and political economic reasons for these injustices will be discussed in this course. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning. The class meetings will consist of lectures, discussions, presentations, teamwork, activities, video/audio materials and projects.",

K. Cha, Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, San Mao, Theresa H. K. Cha and Thi Buy, among others. When possible and meaningful, we will set their autobiographical practices against the grain of male representations of women's lives, and in dialogue with our own autobiographical gestures and utterances.",

    "overview": "Frantz Fanon has famously written that the conditions of modernity have rendered blackness increasingly illegible, fraught with contradictions that push it outside the realm of facile comprehension and explicability. Taking Fanon's polemic as a cue, this graduate seminar will look at a number of late twentieth-century textual and performance sites with radical instances of experimentation where articulations of blackness move into the interstitial space between meaning and non-meaning, coming into being precisely at the moment when the compositional logic of their anticipated forms are ruptured. The course will focus on three primary sites where black artists engage what might be called the poetics of dissolution to examine and critique the processes of racial formation: poetry (where the form of the line or stanza dissolves); music (where sonic interpolations puts additional, if not different, claims on the lyrical content), and visual culture (where the moves toward graphic mimesis are refused delineation). The material under consideration may include work by the poets Nathaniel Mackey, Douglas Kearney, and Harriet Mullen; sound alchemists King Tubby, Alice Coltrane, and MF Doom; and visual artists Glenn Ligon, Hank  Willis Thomas, and Bethany Collins. Theoretical texts may include work by Emily Apter Barthes, Baudrillard, Fred Moten, and Saussure, as well as ethnomusicologists and linguistic anthropologists.",

    "overview": "Christian theorists were convinced that human sexuality underwent an irreversible debasement as a result of the sin of Adam and Eve. Their negative assessment has remained with us until the present day. This course will grapple with the both the origins of this negative bequest as well as some of the anomalies of the medieval tradition. For example, despite the insistence that heterosexuality was ordained by God, the disparagement of physicality and women led to the institutionalization of clerical celibacy in the West. This, in turn, fostered a gay subculture. Likewise, despite the theoretical insistence on a separation between the sexes that was even present in the afterlife, these same theorists not only praised \"virile women,\" but occasionally celebrated cross-dressing in female saints! This course will examine the institutions and ideas that dominated the construction of gender in the Middle Ages. It will also lend insight into not one, but many \"sexualities.\"",

We will study literature in historical context and vis-à-vis other media. The purpose is that the students improve their language and critical analysis skills, while familiarizing themselves with the most important aesthetic and political currents of the last centuries in Spain through literature. We will think in and out of the canon of Spanish literature with a critical approach. Issues such as the construction and deconstruction of authorship, the audience, literary genres, avant-garde experimentation and censorship will be discussed. Novels, poetry, and plays are analyzed with an emphasis on the impact of empire and post-empire, feminism, anti-racism, queerness, and plurilingualism. This course provides a foundation to further study of the Spanish cultures in more advanced courses. Prerequisite (may be taken concurrently): SPANISH 200-0 or 204-0",

This course charts seminal theoretical approaches to literary and cultural analysis through the lens of emotion and affect theory. Beginning with post-Freudian psychoanalysis, the class considers how subjectivity and attachment are staged in theory, literature, and film. Is affect merely an expression of contained, individual inner states? How do emotions form and mediate the subject's relationship to the world? How can we read for emotion in aesthetic form? In response to questions such as these, the class will consider together connections between emotion, aesthetics and ethics also by examining the ways in which this relationship is staged in different media from the scene of the \"talking cure\" to the \"transmission of affect\" through literature.",

Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning.

Rather, this course is one that thinks black feminist—not black \"women's\"—theory and theorizing; this course chronicles the ways that the political, intellectual, ethical, and social resound radically and progressively and names that resonance—and all its vibrations and textures—black feminist theory. Thus, we will, of course, be reading a variety of black women along the jagged gendered spectrum between and beyond \"cis\" and \"trans,\" but more specifically we will be tracing the ways radical politics and ethics arise in such a way as to interrogate the established parameters of race and gender normativity, of our social world.",

Students will explore how these same processes can be applied in public health data collection to be inclusive and validate the methods and ways of knowing that have assisted underserved, underheard, and underrepresented communities in advocating for justice to survive. Course readings will consist of text that provides a critical lens to view qualitative data collection methods through and will include studies in historical and traumatic violence that underscore how people living in Black bodies work to survive by Joy DeGruy and the negotiating processes that Black individuals use to exercise agency and evaluate systemic oppressions that impede how they navigate life as articulated by authors such as Patricia Hill Collins, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, and Jean Stefancic.",

Turkish is becoming the language of global entertainment. In this first quarter, students will immerse themselves in the TV characters' personal stories and everyday realities of life in Istanbul. The highly interactive TV storylines offer ample opportunities to listen to and practice pronunciation, internalize basic vocabulary and polite phrases, as well as learn about verb tenses and moods for more complicated language tasks. The class uses a communicative approach, meaning that group work and language production are emphasized in class.  The course ends with a class trip to a Turkish restaurant in Chicago where students will be able to communicate in Turkish outside of the classroom and utilize the skills they developed throughout the quarter.",

    "overview": "This course offers students tools for thinking in a critical and comparative way about the intersections of religion, law, and politics from a global perspective. Much ink has been spilt considering and reconsidering definitions of religion, secularism, and politics, and how these concepts work to shape each other and the worlds we inhabit. This course asks, what comes next in the study of religion in politics? What does it look like to not only globalize this question by asking about a wider diversity of contexts and histories beyond Europe and its settler colonies but also to interrogate, and even move beyond, vocabularies that have framed and limited discussions of these questions for decades? This transdisciplinary seminar is an experiment in thinking the question of religion and politics in modernity anew. Themes to be considered include sovereignty, governance, coloniality, borders, Indigeneity, human movement, race, and law. Graduate students in politics, history, anthropology, political theory, religious studies, performance studies, theater, rhetoric and public culture, and affiliate disciplines are welcome.",

    "overview": "In this course, we explore how migration and displacement shapes individuals, communities, schools, and policy making. With a focus on the U.S. context, we consider the causes, the processes, and the implications of different types of and reasons for migration (internal and transnational; forced and voluntary). We will interrogate widely circulating assumptions about migration and displacement and think together about productive ways forward. To understand migration and displacement from the perspective of those on the move, we read and discuss narratives that have appeared in academic scholarship, ethnographic accounts, creative nonfiction, and poetry.   This course is also an introduction to being a college student. Participants will read, interpret, and share insights; practice giving a presentation; lead discussion; become more adept at library research; and develop a research project. Everyone will learn together, in and through practice. There will also be an opportunity to experiment with being creative or making something.",

    "overview": "Course title: Civil Military Relations in Democratic Societies\n\nDemocracies around the world require a military to defend their people, values and interests from enemies abroad and within. They require a military to help advance the national interest abroad. However, they also need a military that will not seek to undermine the freedoms and will of the people that make democratic governance possible. In other words, the military must be subordinate to elected leaders and not seek to build a coup. Civil-Military Relations describes the connections that civilian policymakers have with their country's armed forces. It is the boundaries between diplomacy and war. Civilians and their elected leaders should focus on making foreign policy while the military should focus on how to best defend the state. When in good balance, proper relations sustain a democracy as the will of the people, reflected through their elected leaders, prevail. When in poor balance, military leaders can overtake the government in the form of a coup. In this course, we will think about the role of a military in a democratic government and how democracies use their militaries to advance their interests abroad. In addition, we will think about how civilian leaders and military officers ought to interact with one another to sustain a democracy.  Finally, students will apply the current theories and debates in civil-military relations to develop a research project of personal interest. By the end of the course, students will be able to contribute to discussions in the literature through asking and answering questions of their own. They will also be able to become critical consumers of academic literature and be able to communicate their findings to a general audience.",

In the first part of the term, we will study various incarnations of major Greek gods across time, space, and storytelling genres. In the second part of the course, we will focus on stories related to the Trojan War and its aftermath as narrated in the two epic poems transmitted under the name of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and in Athenian tragedy.",

    "overview": "\"The Politics of Theatre\" - this title indicates that the seminar will be based on two hypotheses: Following Jean-Luc Godard and Heiner Müller, the seminar will not examine so-called political theater, but rather theater made political. And different forms of dealing with politics will be analyzed. The only thing they have in common is that in each of the cases to be discussed, theater is not understood as supporting, illustrating, reflecting or replacing politics, but rather that the political must be sought on the level of forms and materials of representation. The fundamental distinction between Le and La Politique (Lacoue-Labarthe, Nancy, Mouffe and others), i.e. the political and politics or politics and the police (Rancière) in French theory of the past decades, which itself draws on German-speaking thinkers of the political such as Karl Marx, Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin and Hannah Arendt, is a prerequisite. We will examine plays from different centuries, literatures and theater contexts from the early modern period to contemporary script-based performance. Questions that will occupy us could include, among others: Coloniality and decolonialization (Shakespeare, Genet, Heiner Müller), political and police dramaturgy (Lessing, Foucault, Brecht/Weigel, A.H. Recke), the theater of capital punishment (Büchner, Derrida), theater and potentiality (Brecht, Benjamin, Heidegger, Agamben), and the (queer) feminist deconstruction of the masculine dispositif of drama and theater (Fleißer, S. Kennedy). The seminar takes up research topics that have occupied me in recent years, but should also be understood as a research context itself, not only and not primarily as mediation, but above all as a joint investigation. This is one of the reasons why the concept of the seminar is discussed with the participants in the first session and adapted according to their interests.",

In particular, we will focus on two major units - the first will explore representations of domestic labor, space, and identity in Mexican cinema. The second major unit will look at representations of Maya subjectivities in recent Guatemalan cinema. Central to our discussions will be an interrogation of the concept of Mexican and Central American cinema as \"national\" or \"regional\" cinemas, consideration of the effects of globalization on Mexican and Central American film industries and cultures, an exploration of transnational film culture and audiences, the role of \"filmmaker as activist,\" and an examination of the relationship between memory, state violence, and visual cultures. Themes of domestic labor, migration, displacement, and Indigeneity will be emphasized.",

    "overview": "The United States is currently home to 5% of the world's population but 25% of its incarcerated population. With close to 2 million people under the control of the American criminal legal system, the United States has more total people who are incarcerated than any other country in the world. Moreover, the United States has one of the most punitive approaches to criminal justice, imposing lengthy prison sentences, forcing people who are incarcerated to spend years—sometimes even decades—in solitary confinement, and providing very few educational, vocational, and recreational programs in prisons.  \n \nPunishment and incarceration also disproportionately impact people of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. While Black Americans and Hispanics make up about 32% of the US population, they constitute 56% of the incarcerated population.\n \nThis course will use a philosophical lens to examine the causes and consequences of this crisis of mass incarceration in the United States, along with possible solutions to it, with a particular emphasis on the theories of punishment grounding our criminal legal system and, thus, our prisons. The course will include students from the Evanston campus and incarcerated students in the Northwestern Prison Education Program. \n\n*Note: This course will take place inside Sheridan Correctional Center in Sheridan, IL. On class days, students will leave Evanston at 8 AM and will return by 3:30 PM. Enrollment is limited to 10 students from Evanston, is by permission only, and requires an application. \n\nIn no more than 500 words each, please respond to the following two questions:\nWhat do you think you would contribute to a class of this kind?\nWhat do you think you would gain from a class of this kind?\nPlease submit responses to Professor Jennifer Lackey at j-lackey@northwestern.edu by May 31, 2024. Admissions decisions will be made by June 10th.",

The practical goal of the seminar is the production of a robust, peer-reviewed version of a dissertation prospectus, composed in accordance with the protocols and deadlines stipulated in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese's Graduate Student Handbook.\n\nOur seminar will adopt the form and dynamics of a writing workshop envisioned as a collective and welcoming space. This means that, while technical, methodological, and stylistic aspects of academic writing will be paramount and regularly discussed and practiced in class discussions and activities, questions related to general welfare, mental health, and intellectual joy are to be considered just as important. For example, we will use the class to discuss the current conditions and challenges of academic writing, the professional and institutional positions of students tasked with the production of doctoral dissertations, the typical pressures and pitfalls experienced by course members and peers in the processes of research and writing, and the strategies and techniques that have been used and could be used to navigate the difficulties that may arise during the process.\n\nBy the same token, the seminar is directed at reflecting and building on participants' previous experiences with academic and professional writing, and all participants will be invited to bring their own practices to the table for collective consideration. To the extent you are willing to share experiences, your personal approach to and relationship with writing—tactics, tricks, and hacks; memorable anecdotes; fears and happy places; practical concerns and professional dreams; and moments of pride and disillusion—will be welcome in the context of our seminar.",

    "overview": "How do students build community at Northwestern University, in the years after pandemic has turned the world upside-down and transformed many social practices? How do cultural anthropologists write about people and places? What is your place at Northwestern? To find out, you will learn and practice cultural anthropology's most famous methods of research and writing, participant observation and writing ethnography. Weekly readings and class discussions will inform your observations of one aspect of college life on campus you choose to study throughout the quarter, building toward a final creative/academic project presentation. An important part of the course consists of in-class roundtables which pair NU campus groups with Evanston and Chicago organizations and individuals examining intersecting power structures such as race, gender, sexuality, and economic inequality, and cultural production. Conducting your own participant-observation research will empower you to 1. make sense of your environment in the current moment, 2. turn an analytical eye toward Northwestern as an institution, and 3. critically develop your new role as a college student. Requirements include participation in class discussion and roundtables, developing your field research project, and your final project presentation which can be creative, analytic, or a mix of both—prior students have written songs, created podcasts, maps, and hand-drawn illustrations to present their research results along with more traditional academic analyses. Course materials include one text for purchase ($18/ebook to $35/new print copy) as well as book chapters, articles, and film/media accessed in Canvas.",

The focus will be the classical tradition, the biblical tradition, and Shakespeare who inherited both and reworked them in the early modern period. The trial of Socrates, the trial of Jesus, biblical prophecy, tragedy in Shakespeare, and a modern work by Melville will be included. Our exploration will be done in the context of theories of justice, and we will read those theories alongside the literature. But we will also heed how literature itself offers elaborations of theories of justice, following their consequences both within legal frameworks and beyond, as they shape the public and intimate lives of people. We will ask how religious ideas of justice inform and depart from secular ideas of justice, how retributive and distributive ideas of justice are imagined and critiqued, and how the relation between justice and law has been conceived.",

In this class, we critically explore the relationship between power, ideology, and cultural narratives in mass media and everyday life. We consider the structural and institutional contexts in which these narratives develop, and how media often mirror and reinforce existing inequity. Through the lens of various intersecting social categories, such as race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, nationality, and religion, we examine media representations of identities, communities, and solidarities, and how audiences receive, resist, and reframe these narratives. Collectively, we trace \"Asian American narratives\" through present-day cultural forms, such as true crime documentaries, reality TV, political advertising, and our own social media feeds. This course provides students with the theoretical tools to develop critical media literacy.",

    "overview": "Are our actions free or fated? What larger forces shape the choices we make? To what do we owe our successes, and what is to blame for our mistakes? In East Asian religions, such questions have been answered with reference to a variety of different concepts of fate, fortune, and karma. These concepts shape not only how people have viewed the world, but also how they have made their way through life. This class focuses on religious approaches to questions of destiny in premodern East Asia. We begin by studying Indian Buddhist ideas of karma and early Chinese notions of fate and fortune preceding Buddhism's arrival in China, then turn to the ways people in China and Japan negotiated these various concepts over the many centuries following the arrival of Buddhism. In the end, we discover important throughlines amid the diversity of religious responses to the problem of destiny in East Asian history.",

    "overview": "Ever since Pentheus' fatal decision to spy on the revels of Dionysus, audiences have had a guilty fascination with the spectacle of addiction—a fascination which crosses not only centuries but disciplines, captivating scientists, policymakers, philosophers, artists, and laypeople alike. This class will trace the evolution of literary representations of addiction across several centuries, from classical depictions of god-induced madness, through the Gothic narratives such as Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde, temperance classics such as Ten Nights in a Barroom (whose impact has often been compared to that of Uncle Tom's Cabin), to the twentieth- and twenty-first century comedies and confessionals that make the bestseller lists today. Through these readings and related critical texts, we will examine the ways that such literature provides a staging ground for public controversy and emerging theories about the artistic, cultural, ethical, and scientific significance and ramifications of addiction. Course readings/viewing will include works of fiction, journalism, and writings from the natural and social sciences as well as popular films. We will also consider practical topics such as how University library resources and experts can help students locate and evaluate key sources and develop authoritative arguments.",

Students will be asked to analyze the readings closely, and to write several essays based on imitations of the style, structure, syntax, and narrative devices found in the readings. Students can also expect to do some brief writing exercises and revisions.",

Readings include theoretical and historical texts, but the primary object of study will be the artworks, exhibitions, and installations themselves. As a museum seminar, we consider the methods of institutions of different scales and types, including alternative galleries and artist-led projects, as they collect and present work by contemporary and historical Black artists. Students must be able to attend site visits that will often extend 1-2 hours past class hours on Fridays because of transportation time.",

Along the way, students will learn about the sound structure of English as they work towards improved pronunciation and fluency. Students will have an opportunity to consider their own oral English proficiency in light of proficiency assessments used at Northwestern, and will receive feedback on Versant test performance and practice sessions.",

    "overview": "Course title: Dystopia in the Americas or How not to Fall into Despair\n\nDystopia is everywhere. From Marvel movies to daily news predicting natural disasters in the upcoming decades due to human extractive activities, today we are constantly exposed to dire visions of the future. However, the word \"dystopia\" has been used to describe a sharp critique of the present while maintaining the principle of utopian hope, that is, the belief that we can live better and actually prevent catastrophe. Dystopias can be political, social, environmental, racial—among others—but they all have something in common: they express our anxieties stemming from our experience of the present. This course offers a transnational overview of different types of dystopias (ecological, political, racial, technological) in the Americas and promotes critical engagement with these narratives. We will explore movies, tv series, short stories, and artworks from Latin America-Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico—and the United States to understand how dystopias can articulate our deepest fears and anxieties, but also how, in critiquing the present, they might suggest alternatives to think outside our nightmares and envision better futures.",

    "overview": "The American courtroom has provided a venue through which Americans have grappled with moral panics, political tensions, celebrity scandal, and mass violence. The high-profile prosecutions of people ranging from Lizzie Borden to OJ Simpson had a powerful hold on American culture at the time. And although these trials rarely had a significant effect on the law, they remain potent cultural touchstones, their stories told and retold through movies, television shows, podcasts, songs, and souvenirs. This course examines several famous American trials—famous both in their time and today—to understand and examine key themes in American political, legal, social, economic, and cultural history. We will focus largely on the twentieth century—a period of multiple \"Trials of the Century\" —to see how each trial crystallized broader political and social tensions over ethnicity, gender, race, religion, politics, sexuality, and social status. Each trial combined elements of both formal law and public theater; through these trials, we'll examine the relationship between legal reasoning and storytelling. We will also examine how and why we return to such stories; how do they endure in historical memory, and what tensions do they help us think about today?",

    "overview": "Each year, world leaders gather to negotiate pathways to addressing climate change. As the largest gathering of heads of state, the annual Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP) shines a light on our collective futures, bringing hope and skepticism around climate change to the fore. Despite nearly three decades of negotiations, the world is unlikely to avoid devastating impacts from climate change, where average global temperature increases will exceed the 2oC goal and is nearing well over 3oC. What, then, do COPs achieve? What role do they play in addressing global climate change? What role does science, business, technology, solidarity movements, and civil society play in shaping the global politics of climate change, and there with the potential to address climate change? \n\nIn this research seminar, students will design and conduct original empirical research on the Twenty-ninth Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC, which will be held in Baku, Azerbaijan from November 11 - 24, 2024 with some virtual components accessible online. The seminar is structured to establish a baseline understanding of global climate governance. Students enrolled in this course should consider themselves research apprentices and collaborators. There are three parts to this course: literature review, research design, and execution. Students are expected to conduct original research related to their dissertations or senior theses OR can participate as a researcher in an ongoing collaborative research project that examines the politics of sites of global environmental governance like COPs. \n\nThe course is appropriate for graduate and advanced undergraduate students interested in conducting research on Climate COPs from different disciplinary backgrounds. Advanced undergraduates will take part in the digital side of the COP convening, while graduate students will have the option to travel to the COP, depending on additional course commitments during the fall quarter. Enrollment is by permission only; interested students should apply through the Roberta Buffett Institute for Global Affairs. The application will launch in early spring quarter. Please visit buffett.northwestern.edu for more information, including details on travel funding.",

    "overview": "AY25: Why is the Korean-Japanese relationship so strained to this day? How might we think about the colonial period (1910-1945) on the Korean peninsula from our present, and about intra-Asian colonialism?\n\nThis introductory course offers students some snapshots of colonial era Korean literature and culture and tackles difficult but rewarding questions about this period. We will read short fictions from prominent authors of the time and discuss visual cultures (illustrations, art, films) surrounding New Woman, Indigeneity, race, and wartime mobilization. The course also invites students to consider the often-forgotten Korean diaspora and migrations created under the vast Japanese empire that exceed the limits of the peninsula: what does it mean to be \"Korean\" in the shifting identities of the colonized in these different places around the empire? Finally, the course examines more contemporary representations of the colonial period to think about how the colonial period haunts the present as we desire and consume the colonial.\n\nNo prior knowledge of Korean language or culture is necessary to take this course. Course assignments include a deconstructed paper (short writing exercises), a group presentation, and a final creative group project. Participation in class discussion and peer collaboration are important aspects of this course.",

    "overview": "Topic: Mobsters, Desperados, and Samurai: Outlaws across Genres and Cultures\n\nAs iconic anime such as \"Cowboy Beebop\" and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan's classic album \"Liquid Swords\" demonstrate, the outcast samurai, the desperado, and the mobster have been adapted and (re)purposed across national boundaries and divisions of genre. Japanese artists are experimenting with Western gunslingers at the same time as American rappers are imagining themselves as the Ronin of Staten Island. What explains the persistent and global appeal of these rebellious figures? And how are they transformed as they move from one cultural context to another? Looking at a broad range of film, anime, manga, music, and literature from the 20th and 21st centuries, this course pays specific attention to the way outlaws associated with a particular culture or genre are adapted beyond their original formulations to express new social realities. From the samurai in Paris to the highwaymen of Neo-Tokyo, we will attempt to understand how and why these icons of outlaw culture have been able to captivate audiences all over the planet.",

    "overview": "In the latter half of the twentieth century, the time-honored genre of nature writing saw the emergence of a parallel literary tradition: Writing (and other media) devoted to drawing the world's attention to impending environmental catastrophe - and the steps human beings could take to avert it.  In this course, students will examine the intersection of these two genres - that of traditional nature writing and environmental activist texts - with an eye to developing a portfolio of writing and communication work that showcases their unique voices, rhetorical strategies, and perspectives on this critically important topic.  We will consider how people come to develop felt relationships to the natural world and what rhetorical and activist strategies seem to have the greatest potential to spark positive change.  To that end, students will be asked to keep a journal of observation and reflections on the natural world as a foundation for later research and argumentative work.  Some classes and coursework will be conducted outside at a range of campus and off-campus locations, weather permitting, to allow for observation and reflection workshops.\n\nCourse readings/viewing will include some classics authors such as Rachel Carson and Ken Saro-Wiwa (winner of the Goldman Environmental Prize), as well as selections from more recent work by Robin Wall Kimmerer (Braiding Sweetgrass), Andreas Malm (How to Blow Up a Pipeline), Johan Eklöf (The Darkness Manifesto), Alan Weisman (The World Without Us), Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Florence Williams (The Nature Fix), Greta Thunberg, and Jonathan Franzen. We will also look at activist documentaries and consider practical topics such as how University library resources and experts can help students locate and evaluate key sources and develop authoritative arguments.",

Such texts and films are no longer inherently considered completely marginal, despite not yet being a major part of the literary canon. This course presents a broad examination of LGBT/queer Hebrew literature and culture - from the new wave of gay and lesbian literature in the 1990s up to some more contemporary works. What stories and questions do Hebrew queer literary texts and films present? Is queerness in the Israeli context being celebrated or is it still fighting for acceptance and tolerance? Throughout the course, we will explore Israeli prose works and films that engage with LGBT/queer identities and topics, and examine questions and themes, such as \"coming out of the closet,\" \"queer identity,\" \"the lesbian continuum,\" \"heteronormativity/ homonormativity,\" and the queer notion of \"no future.\" The literary and cultural texts will be accompanied by theoretical texts from Adrienne Rich, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lee Edelman, J. Halberstam, and more. No previous knowledge of Hebrew is required! All the Hebrew texts will be read in translation, and all the films will be accompanied by English subtitles.",

Notions of what was normative and what was aberrant were constantly being tested. Public scandals served as moments of stress, revealing the cultural faultlines in the changing world of early modern England. Behavior that was considered appropriate in one venue spilled out into other venues where it was considered unseemly. These cultural energies found their way into plays and poems, which reenacted the wider struggles over social norms.",

In this course, the topic of Native American relationships to land, land management and cosmology all attend to scholarship on historical and present-day power dynamics in the United States and Canada as they pertain to Native American religious rights and treaty obligations. This is achieved by examining core cosmologies of selected tribes and communities and how they conceptualize the spiritual and material worlds that they live in. Central to the class will be a focus on the sacred aspects of tribal identity and the role that landscape plays in the creation and maintenance of these identities. Along with cultural perspectives, the class will cover laws pertaining to religious freedoms and how they are applied to Native American contexts throughout the United States and Canada, along with the histories and philosophies that have, and still influence these policies.",

Has your own language changed since you came to Northwestern? What patterns govern the conversations we have, and how do we create social relationships, communities, and identities in those conversations? Why do some people mix multiple languages when they speak and write? Is it, like, ok for me to, like, use like so much? What about um or ain\\'t or ya know?

    "overview": "This course is an introduction to research methods from a sociological point of view. It aims to show how sociologists (and related social scientists) do research. We will examine fundamental concepts in research design (from sampling to bias), many different types of methods (from experiments to surveys), research ethics, and the benefits and limitations of various methodological approaches. In this hands-on course, we will learn about various methods, research ethics, and the fundamentals of research design by interacting with scholarly articles and practice and by looking at how social science research factors in our everyday lives (from social media posts to stories on the nightly news). A capstone project includes development of a full research proposal.",

Examples of materials include newspaper articles, podcasts, song lyrics, maps, personal essays, TV, and film. In studying how we define race, we will also consider the intersections of citizenship and immigration, gender and sexuality, and more. This seminar helps students transition into college-level inquiry and into being conscientious and ethical members of a diverse learning community. Students will demonstrate their new knowledge about racial formation in the United States through drafting and revising journal entries, analytical papers, and creative assignments.",

Beginning with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798 and ending with the country's occupation by the British in 1882, this course will trace Cairo's cultural transformations through close attention to a range of objects and sites—paintings, political cartoons, urban monuments, museums, world's fairs, architecture, and scientific illustration—produced at the nexus of Franco-Ottoman rivalry and cooperation. This course challenges conventional binaries of East vs. West, traditional vs. modern, and local vs. global by exploring art's active roles in shaping urban life across these two cities. Special attention will be paid to the transcultural formation of national, racial, gender, and sexual identities.",

    "overview": "The course begins with a foundational competency in main concepts from the French philosopher Michel Foucault, including discipline and biopower, the productivity and plurality of power; normalization and its dependence on \"abnormality;\" the conditions under which freedom is also a form of subjection; disciplinary and punitive societies, the historical a priori. We review many of the aspects of Foucault's work that have strongly impacted inquiry in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Turning, in the course's second section, to the work of French Martinian philosopher and decolonial theorist Frantz Fanon, we will critically compare Foucault's and Fanon's approaches to power, psychiatric medicine, families, biopolitics, self-surveillance, knowledge, selfhood, alterity, and colonization. Challenging both thinkers we will ask how these approaches both reinforce each other and, at times, call each other into question. Students will have the opportunity to write on each of the two French philosophers jointly or separately.\n\nThe course is reading intensive. It will include weekly contributions to class debate including online postings. your critical responses to the readings, and to each other are encouraged. The course is open to both undergraduates and graduates and includes a lecture component and separate discussion sections at the undergraduate and graduate level.",

    "overview": "Very broadly, feminism is both a political movement and a theoretical commitment to ending gender-based oppression. Feminists have contributed important work to every area of philosophy, posing distinctive questions and developing distinctive critiques, views, and concepts. In this course we will learn about feminist contributions to various \"core\" areas of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and social philosophy. Issues we may consider include: ‘what is gender?' (metaphysics), ‘how does gender impact our standing as knowers' (epistemology), ‘how do and how should gender norms operate in our moral theories?' (ethics), ‘what are sexism and misogyny, and how can we counteract them?' (social philosophy). We'll also think about the commitments, assumptions, and aims shared by feminists across philosophy and what it is that connects this work across philosophy.",

    "overview": "More than once between 1500 and 1700, people in early modern England learned of a new world—the Americas after the voyages of Columbus in 1492 and of Ralegh in 1585, the moons of Earth and of Jupiter observed through the telescopes of Harriot and Galileo by telescope in 1609, the intimate worlds of microscopy explored by Hooke in 1665.  As their worlds widened, deepened, and multiplied, English writers and thinkers invented new worlds of their own: fairy realms, enchanted islands, kingdoms of darkness, lunar landscapes, perfect polities and nightmare ones, imagined worlds that could critique of their own or propose and explore things that seemed impossible in it.  Despite being avowed as fictions, usually, these speculative worlds claimed value, seriousness, and even kinds of truth through the extravagance of their fantasies, while also asserting their pleasurableness and recreativity.  In this class we will explore some of these worlds of imagination and how and why early modern writers crafted them, including Thomas More's Utopia, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, and Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World, as well as related works on exploration and science by Columbus, Cortes, Galileo, and others.",

    "overview": "This course offers students tools for thinking in a critical and comparative way about the intersections of religion, law, and politics from a global perspective. Much ink has been spilt considering and reconsidering definitions of religion, secularism, and politics, and how these concepts work to shape each other and the worlds we inhabit. This course asks, what comes next in the study of religion in politics? What does it look like to not only globalize this question by asking about a wider diversity of contexts and histories beyond Europe and its settler colonies but also to interrogate, and even move beyond, vocabularies that have framed and limited discussions of these questions for decades? This transdisciplinary seminar is an experiment in thinking the question of religion and politics in modernity anew. Themes to be considered include sovereignty, governance, coloniality, borders, Indigeneity, human movement, race, and law. Graduate students in politics, history, anthropology, political theory, religious studies, performance studies, theater, rhetoric and public culture, and affiliate disciplines are welcome.",

    "overview": "This course examines how socioeconomic and environmental factors work together to cause hazards and disasters in human society. In this course we learn the main concepts about disaster such as preparedness, vulnerability, resilience, response, mitigation, etc. We learn that a disaster does not have the same effect on everyone (all groups of people), and factors of social inequality such as race, ethnicity, class, and gender, make people more vulnerable to impacts of disasters. Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning. The class meetings will consist of lecture, discussion, presentations, teamwork, activities, video/audio materials and projects.",

    "overview": "Education, despite being touted as a great equalizer, is a highly contested site of struggle. It is a struggle to get in, a struggle to get through, and a struggle to figure out what happens after. Throughout each of these time periods academic and journalistic coverage of the Asian American student experience argue that social, cultural, political, economic, and familial pressures converge and compound on this population leading to unfulfilling, unpleasant, and unbelievable outcomes.\nFollowing that claim, this course explores three interlinked and overlapping themes for the quarter: 1) The persistence of the model minority myth and its impact on higher education policy, 2) parent and teacher expectations of Asian American students in K-12 and university settings, and 3) Asian American student mental health and well-being. We will study student activism and the emergence of Ethnic Studies/Asian American Studies in higher education,explore contemporary intersectional Asian American student experiences, and critically examine the politics of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" rhetoric.\nIn what ways do Asian American students survive, negotiate, and resist external and internal pressures of success and excellence? How do Asian Americans begin to redefine success on their own terms? Texts for this course may include erin Ninh's Passing for Perfect; Christine Yano, Neal Akatsuka, and the Asian American Collective's Straight A's: Asian American College Students in Their Own Words, and Debbie Lum's documentary Try Harder!",

    "overview": "The term \"Latinx\" refers to category of human beings and a system of human categorization that arrived on this continent as a result of Eurocolonialism and the outset of western modernity. Regarding the former, the term is necessitated by a history of conflict and contradiction in the U.S. It is made relevant, moreover, within a pervasive legacy of racial and/or ethnic inequality. Latinos/as are then one amongst an assortment of racialized groups identified as historically disadvantaged, under-represented, or mis-represented; existing on the margins of U.S. civil society. These circumstances mandate Latinx Studies (along with related fields such as African American Studies, Asian American Studies, or Native American Studies) as a vital area of analysis within any university's curriculum in so much that universities are intended to facilitate debates and encourage an understanding about democracy and its discontents. In sum, one cannot fully understand how a society works without paying a critical attention to how it has failed or continues to fail in upholding its defining ethos or set of principles. As aforementioned, the term Latinx also refers to a way of being human. It refers to cultural adaptations and political strategies mandated by genealogies of exclusion, exploitation, and expendability and that have been manifested within the works of Latinx artists, activists, and intellectuals. This course is a survey of those works and the structural conditions from which they emerge.",

This course is divided into three parts corresponding to her three studio albums. We will focus on her visual storytelling, stage performances, and poetics to see how she engages with icons of Spanish cultural history ranging from Cervantes to Goya to La Niña de los Peines. The analysis of her body of work is the starting point to inquire into the cultural and social history of flamenco, including its Roma, Black, Jewish, and Andalusian roots, as well as the migrant history of flamenco in Catalonia and Latin America. Debates on cultural appropriation and appreciation will be addressed as we study Rosalía's engagement with (Afro)Latin American genres—reggaeton, bachata, bolero—or through the analysis of the long tradition of flamenco in Japan. We will reflect on the ways she explores fame, fashion, or feminism, and on what we mean when we term something \"experimental\" or \"avant-garde\".",

This course will explore the history of different peoples who made the Americas their home during the past 500 years through the study of the material remains they left behind: architecture, burials, food remains, clothing and jewelry, etc. These communities include those who had already lived here, those who came here willingly, and those that were conscripted to come here through the institution of slavery. Attention will be focused on the presentation and/or exclusion of groups in depictions of history and in the creation new identities (ethnogenesis) in different parts of the Americas. It will also consider the ways in which power and economy intersect with other forms of identity, such as class, gender, and sexuality. The course will survey a variety of communities, concentrating on Indigenous Peoples, as well as people of European, African and Asian descent in American contexts. While there will be course material which touch on French and Iberian colonial contexts, class projects will primarily draw on study of artifacts and communities in the Eastern United States and the Anglophone Caribbean.",

Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?\n\nSociology is a huge field of study, and includes an enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

It wasn't until I discovered statistics that I started to love numbers. Math is too often taught as though the mysteries of the universe were discovered long ago.  In contrast, statistics is one large puzzle, an ever moving and changing enigma with no \"right\" or \"wrong\".  There is no single way to solve this puzzle - and each method has unique strengths and weaknesses.  Thus, the greatest scientists are those with the greatest imagination.   This class is not your usual statistics course.  Instead of presenting statistics beginning with the math, we begin with the mystery, learning the math along the way - not as the ultimate goal, but as a guidepost for unlocking life's unending hidden questions."

Throughout, will read a range of sources including poetry and prose, and long- and short-form works to understand the ideas and imaginaries that inhere in Black literature. We will also listen to Black music, including, the Blues, jazz, and Hip Hop and view television and films that have been important entries in the cultural history of Black life.",

    "overview": "What does psychology look like in practice? How does one uncover psychological phenomena? What are the controversies in the field of psychology, and how might we as researchers overcome them? This course covers the how of psychological research. Scaffolded by the scientific method and informed by contemporary challenges and controversies in the field of psychology, we will work in small research teams to empirically investigate a psychological topic of interest from start to finish. This includes brainstorming a study, conducting a literature review, designing an experiment, considering the ethical constraints, recruiting participants and collecting data, analyzing said data, and writing up and disseminating the findings. In the first part of the class, we will complete two mini research projects before jumping into our own independent research projects for the latter half of the class. The entire class is project-oriented and hands-on, and feedback and support are provided at every step. As we engage in our research projects, we will also become acquainted with psychological research issues and controversies in the field. Our class design will mirror the format of most psychology labs, as we will be expected to (and will be evaluated on our capacity to) work collaboratively and communicate with our research teams. Moreover, our major class assignments-including the APA research papers and conference presentation-are all part and parcel of the everyday work of a psychology researcher.",

We will frame our discussions of within historical, political, and economic contexts throughout Latin America to examine how hemispheric flows of global capital, culture, and knowledge impact gender expansive identities and world building. Readings will reflect diverse forms of scholarship, from traditional sources produced in academic settings to memoirs, manifestos, graffiti, film, art, poetry, novels, social media and other forms of virtual content creation. As we explore, we will also consider more specific questions, including: what are travesti politics? What does it mean to have the right to be a monster? What happens to gender when one crosses a border? In what ways do transness and gender expansivity relate to institutionalized structures of power? What indigenous subjectivities might be understood as gender expansive? Reading knowledge of Spanish is recommended, but not required.",

We do so by reading short stories, poems, and articles, watching and discussing movie clips, short films and videos, and making in-class presentations. During the year we touch on a variety of themes involving South Asian culture and society, travel, literary traditions, the natural world, etc. By the end of the three-quarter sequence, students attain intermediate-mid or higher language proficiency in Hindi-Urdu.\n\nNote: Please purchase all the required textbooks in the fall quarter, as this is the only quarter that they are ordered during the year.",

    "overview": "Unethical Media\n\nIn recent years, the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements have challenged how scholars approach moral questions surrounding the works, artists or genres they select for syllabi and public exhibitions. Yet as this crucial debate around the ethics of pedagogy has grown, there has been no robust discussion about how we treat these same works in research contexts. What does it mean to feel morally conflicted about picking a novel, theorist, film or image for a class, but less so when it comes to analyzing that same material in an article or talk? As scholars, why do we want our object to be \"good\" all the time?\nThis is a class about what happens when good scholars study bad things, highlighting how this practice has always been a key part of critique. It is often by running up against critical thought that a media work becomes \"ethical\" or \"unethical\" in the first place. Moreover, the question of how to engage with \"unethical media\" motivates a whole array of critical argumentative comportments - it shows us how to canonize, how to excuse, how to elevate, how to politicize, how to aestheticize, how to love or hate - and in this way the question of ethics helps us to assume the identity of a scholar. To gain perspective on this process, our class will look at the intersection of contemporary theory and moral philosophy, along with films, photographs, graphic novels and radio dramas that try to deal morally with issues of aesthetic distance, visual violence, cancel culture, scholarly privilege, disgrace, eco-pessimism, and the ethical representation of sexuality, gender expression and race.\nTexts change a little from year to year. Theorists may include: Chinua Achebe, Elizabeth Anscombe, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Georges Didi-Huberman, Immanuel Kant, José Esteban Muñoz, Sianne Ngai, Susan Sontag, Judith Jarvis Thompson and Linda Williams. Key media artists may include Anna Biller, Sophie Calle, Alfred Hitchcock, Spike Lee, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, Jane Gillooly, Kelly Reichardt and Cindy Sherman.",

This course examines the socially constructed nature of ‘Asian American' as a political label. How have politicians navigated this identity — in relation to public opinion, voting behavior, stereotypes, partisan discourse, and self-presentation? What about activism and resistance outside of the dominant political structure? Throughout the course, we will trace the political lives of Asian Americans who have chosen differing paths in relation to the existing U.S. political structure.",

It describes the goals involved in establishing many different kinds of public policies as well as the stumbling blocks along the way. We will engage debates about issues that are at the core of contemporary political debates in the United States, such as gun control, student debt cancellation, and other topics. We will also discuss other topics that are not at the center of contemporary discussion but open a lens onto deeper issues, for example, playgrounds, baby formula, and the federal civil service. Our goal is to build a vocabulary and framework for critically evaluating public policy ideas and better understanding the substance of political conflict in wealthy democracies like the United States.",

    "overview": "The Second World War reshaped Asia: Japan, attempting to consolidate the region under its own power, forced the transformation of China, leading to Communist revolution there. Japan then suffered a massive defeat, forcing further transformation of its own society in planned and unanticipated directions, as well as of Korea and Taiwan. The war also destroyed the British, Dutch, and Japanese empires and vastly strengthened colonial resistance to other imperial powers, transforming South and Southeast Asia, and allowing the United States to play a larger role in Asian affairs, leading to U.S. military involvement in Korea and Vietnam. The conflict wrought unprecedented destruction: entire cities were leveled, whole populations decimated. Civilians were often victims, but also participated in other ways. They experienced a \"total war\" for which governments mobilized societies to a degree never before seen. This course will concentrate on the dilemmas that faced the war leaders and ordinary individuals, occupiers and the occupied alike.",

Two types of methods are considered in detail: observed data and data augmentation methods. The observed data methods are applied directly to the likelihood or to the posterior distribution. These include: Newton-Raphson, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior distribution. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples. Overall, this course provides the student with a good introduction to the field, the ability to read application papers, and the ability to apply these methods to problems of interest to the student. Students understand at a heuristic level how the methods work and when a given method may be preferred over another.",

While it can be difficult and intimidating to publicly present your work, and to publicly critique or question another's work, we will undertake both in the spirit of support and assistance in the hopes of creating a community of researchers, writers, and scholars.

    "overview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\nThe instructor of this course is Richard Jolly.\nThis course provides students with the social science tools needed to solve organizational problems and influence the actions of individuals, groups and organizations. It prepares managers to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change. This is accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics, corporate culture and strategic organizational design.\nThe goal of this course is to create, develop, and enhance your leadership skills. The course is designed to prepare you to lead high-performing, successful firms in the future and to effectively steer your own careers. These will be the twin themes of the course: (1) how to establish, manage, and lead prosperous firms and (2) how to develop a thriving career for oneself.\nA key leadership task is to assemble the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and groups into those\ncombinations that best solve the organizational problem at hand. You must manage people, information, and\nprocesses to accomplish organizational goals. You must make things happen, often under conditions or time\nframes that are not of your own choosing. The successful execution of these goals requires leaders to be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence, and motivate others, manage the diversity of their\npersonal contacts, tap into and motivate the human and social capital of organizational members, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organizational change.\nThis course prepares you to achieve these objectives. You will learn fundamental tools from the behavioral and\nsocial sciences that will improve your ability to analyze organizational dynamics and take robust action.",

    "overview": "This seminar offers an introduction to small-N and case study methods. In political science, this field is generally known as qualitative methodology. In sociology, this field is generally known as comparative-historical methodology. The course focuses on tools for describing social and political phenomena and for analyzing causal relationships among these phenomena. The course does not consider tools specifically oriented toward interpretive and critical analysis. Nor does the course consider methods of data collection, such as archival research, ethnography, and interview methods. The course focuses on recent methodological writings rather than classical pieces. The readings are not specific to any substantive subfield in political science or sociology. Many of the substantive articles are written by former Northwestern students who have taken this course. The course assumes no prior background in small-N and case study methodology, but the material is advanced and challenging.",

As one of the founders of the Law and Society movement observed, \"law is too important to leave to lawyers.\" Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical, disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology, history, anthropology, political science, critical studies, and psychology) in order to explore the sociology of law and law\\'s role primarily in the American context (but with some attention to international law and global human rights efforts). The thematic topics to be discussed include law and social control; law\\'s role in social change; and law\\'s capacity to reach into complex social relations and intervene in existing normative institutions and organizational structures.\n\nCross-listed with Legal_ST 206-0",

    "overview": "This course offers an introduction to major artistic monuments and artistic developments of the medieval period (roughly 300-1450 CE) with a focus on Europe. It surveys a diverse range of works of art and architecture from this period and positions them within their original social, political, spiritual, and economic contexts. Lectures and discussion sections will trace the shifting ways in which images were defined and perceived over time and consider how the flow of objects and styles linked Europeans to broader world systems. We will also identify key moments in the birth and development of architectural forms still common today such as churches and mosques. Students will develop skills in visual analysis and gain a basic understanding of the methods and aims of art historical study.",

    "overview": "Indigeneities and Textuality in Latin America\n\nThis course explores the notion of indigeneity and its attendant textual manifestations and representations in literary and cultural production in Latin America. First, we will consider some definitions of the term, ranging from the implicit in colonial-era texts, to the explicit in 19th and 20th century narratival and essayistic production. Secondly, we will dive into the large, diverse scholarship—much of it contemporary and ranging in origin from social sciences such as anthropology and archaeology to humanities such as history and literary studies—that has attempted to articulate indigeneity in connection to the demands of, alternately, nationalisms, vindicatory movements, social revolution, identitarian politics, and other political and cultural formations in the continent. Key amongst our considerations will be understanding not simply the shapes that indigeneity takes within these disciplinary, cultural and political contexts, but also the mechanisms that allow it to move and transform between them. We will pay special attention to the place of writing and will seek to account for the generation of indigeneity from lettered and cultural objects and their historical moments. Readings will be selected from a range of primary and secondary texts and may include Guaman Poma de Ayala, El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Popol Vuh, el Manuscrito de Huarochirí, Manuel Gamio, José Carlos Mariátegui, Fausto Reinaga, Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, José María Arguedas, Gamaliel Churata, Alison Spedding, Blanca Wiethüchter, César Calvo, Rigoberta Menchú, Marisol de la Cadena, Gonzalo Lamana, Mary Louise Pratt, Joanne Rappaport, Tom Cummins, Bruce Mannheim, Martin Lienhard, el Taller de Historia Oral Andina, and others.

    "overview": "This class aims to introduce students to the history and culture of Berlin from 1900 to the present. Drawing on a wide range of media, from literature through film to music, the class concentrates on a series of transformative moments in German cultural history seen through the prism of Berlin. Students will engage with the varied historical, socio-political, and artistic changes in German culture throughout the twentieth century, including the vibrant and provocative culture of the 1920s and early 1930s, with a focus on changing forms of gender identity (the \"New Woman\") and sexual subcultures (as in the film Cabaret). Further, students will examine the everyday and extraordinary history of German-Jews in Germany around the caesura of the Jewish genocide executed by the National Socialists.  After examining the megalomaniacal plans that the Nazis made for Berlin, the class turns to the devastated city of 1945 and the divided city of the Cold War, where the conflict between \"East\" and \"West\" emerges in the \"concrete\" form of the Berlin Wall.  The final weeks concentrate on the events surrounding the collapse of the Wall and the creation of the Berlin Republic. Students will also encounter the changing face of national culture in light of the migration of the so-called Turkish \"guest workers\" of the post-War years, particularly through the art of later generations of Turkish-German authors and filmmakers in Berlin. In addition to reading major works of 20th-century literature, students will engage with visual media, in particular film, photography, and other visual art, to acquire a sense of the breathtaking scope of change in the urban context peculiar to twentieth century Berlin. When possible, field trips to Berlin-related events in larger Chicago will be an integral part of the syllabus. This course will demonstrate why cosmopolitan Berlin continues to attract attention and remains a magnetic international destination with a biography and personality all its own.\n\nThis course is taught in English",

Black bodies, for example, are often the tied to (un)health because they are stereotyped as in need to be controlled, managed, and \"guided\" into healthfulness. In the U.S., these narrow stereotypes are just a few of the ways Black bodies get defined. In this course, we will move beyond those restrictive stereotypes, guided by questions such as, \"How does culture define health?\", \"How does the food pipeline affect the health of certain bodies?\" and \"What does it mean to live in an obesogenic environment?\" In this course, we examine the connection between health, culture, food, and environment with a focus on what is silenced and what is loud when generating \"fixes\" for \"diseased\" bodies. Silence refers to the disregard and dismissiveness of the narratives and experiences around the oppressions attached to the health of certain bodies. Yet, this silence echoes as Loud when connected to their culture, food, and environment when discussing diseases highlighted in Black bodies such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.",

    "overview": "This class considers what it means to conceptualize, articulate, and actualize a liberatory Black educational project within U.S. public schools structured by anti-Black solidarity. In the first section of the course, we explore the fight to desegregate public schools and the ways the historic Brown v. Board of Education case transformed schooling for Black children and their communities. In considering the impact of the Brown decision on the experiences of Black students in U.S. public schools, we interrogate the rebukes of Brown including the various educational projects (community control, Panther freedom schools, the Black independent school movement etc.) advanced in Brown's aftermath. In the second section of the course, we explore the myriad ways Black students experience antiblackness and anti-Black racism in U.S. public schools contemporarily, as well as the ways Black students, educators, administrators, community and family members, and scholars have articulated what the notion of liberation may mean in the face of antiblackness. In the final section of the course, we consider the tensions and possibilities in the desire to \"get free\" within the confines of U.S. public schools.",

    "overview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\nThe instructors of \"Lessons in Non-Profit Management\" are: Mary Elizabeth Graettinger \u0026 Paul Sznewajs\nThis course is jointly sponsored by Business Institutions and a student organization called campusCatalyst.  The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

Topics to be studied include the dynamics of revolutionary social change; the building of international working-class and national liberation movements; socialism as an economic system; and socialist approaches to gender, race, and identity.",

    "overview": "To borrow a phrase from Aristotle: sex is said in many ways. The word \"sex\" can refer to the domain of the erotic, that is, to sexual desire and sexual activity. It can also refer to certain biological categories related to an animal's reproductive role, such as female, male, or intersex. Among humans, \"sex,\" along with the nearby term \"gender,\" can also refer to cultural or social categories like woman, man, or nonbinary. And there is also \"sex\" in the sense of sexual orientation, a set of categories describing an individual's typical pattern of sexual attraction, such as lesbian, gay, straight, or bisexual. Needless to say, things get complicated pretty quickly.    In this seminar, we will read and discuss recent philosophical attempts to make sense of all this. The course will cover a wide range of topics, including: What is sexual desire? What (if anything) is sexual perversion? What is the best account of concepts like gender identity or sexual orientation? How (if at all) do those concepts relate to biological sex? What about the ethics and politics of sex? Is there anything wrong, morally speaking, with casual sex, or with the buying and selling of sex? Readings for this course will be drawn mostly from contemporary philosophical sources.",

Since the birth of the motion picture, films portraying Native Americans (often with non-Native actors in redface) have drawn upon earlier frontier mythology, art, literature, and Wild West performances. These depictions in film have embedded romanticized and stereotyped ideas about Native Americans in the imaginations of audiences throughout the United States and around the world. In this course, we will critically examine representations of Native Americans in film and TV, ranging from the origins of the motion picture industry to the works of contemporary Indigenous filmmakers who challenge earlier paradigms. We will reflect upon revisionist narratives, Indigenous aesthetics and storytelling techniques, reflexivity, and parody. Throughout the quarter, we will view and discuss ethnographic, documentary, and narrative media.",

Real-world communication is not like this at all. This seminar examines communication in our non-ideal world. Our focus will be several forms of deceptive communication: lying, bullshitting, and misleading. We will explore a wide range of topics: what are the linguistic cues to deceptive communication, if any? does lying necessarily involve deception? why is there so much bullshit in contemporary political speech? how is fake news related to lying, misleading, and bullshitting? is fake news a useful notion at all? Our goal will be to figure out what tools and concepts we need to understand the varieties of deception that characterize human language interaction.",

    "overview": "Topic: Black Art and Ecology\n\nIn conjunction with several exhibitions and public installations on view in the fall of 2024, this course will study the ways in which Black artists in Chicago have engaged with environmental justice, social and natural ecologies, and the space of the city over the past 80 years. We will study artists' use of sustainable practices and reclaimed materials, the critique of spatial inequality and the space of the city itself as an artistic medium through urban farming, public art, and community engagement. Readings include theoretical and historical texts, but the primary object of study will be the artworks, exhibitions, and installations themselves. As a museum seminar, we consider the methods of institutions of different scales and types, including alternative galleries and artist-led projects, as they collect and present work by contemporary and historical Black artists. Students must be able to attend site visits that will often extend 1-2 hours past class hours on Fridays because of transportation time.",

    "overview": "Many diseases of contemporary society, including ailments like obesity, diabetes, and depression, have only emerged as major health issues in recent human history. In addition, different human groups or ethnicities vary markedly in the burden of these conditions, with factors like poverty, inequality and discrimination consistently predicting who is most affected. What might account for these common findings?  In this course we explore two related ideas to gain insights into these issues. The first is that many modern ailments may be viewed as an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our biology during much of human evolution. The second is that differences in factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical factors, help explain why some groups tend to be more affected by these conditions than others. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive and sensitive to the environments that we inhabit. We will then use these principles to explore domestic and global case studies that illustrate the power of evolutionary principles to shed light on why we get sick, including the role of social, economic and political factors as drivers of major disparities in disease burden.",

    "overview": "It has been argued that the sense of the tragic disappeared in the modern era, and yet many plays continued to stage characters facing their destiny and questioning its meaning. Reading Racine, Musset, Camus, Beckett, and Koltès will be an opportunity for students to reflect on the persistence and the transformations of tragedy in modern French theater. Identifying the theatrical forms (comedy, tragedy, lyrical tragedy, drama…) and cultural genres (Classicism, Romanticism, Absurdism…) that have shaped the history of French theater will enable us to highlight the constant dialogue between literature and society and to assess the social, political, cultural, and historical factors that have framed the (re)writing of tragedy from early to late modernity.",

Thus, we will, of course, be reading a variety of black women along the jagged gendered spectrum between and beyond \"cis\" and \"trans,\" but more specifically we will be tracing the ways radical politics and ethics arise in such a way as to interrogate the established parameters of race and gender normativity, of our social world.",

This course uses microeconomic theory to acquaint students with various aspects of the subnational government sector, including expenditure, financing, and policy issues. We start by reviewing under what situation is the government provision desirable. We then study how levels of state goods and services are determined using voting and Tiebout models. After discussing user charges and intergovernmental grants, we will explore the main source of state and local governmental revenue: taxes. The course will end with policy analysis and application in education, health and welfare.",

It has been examined from multiple perspectives: as a sexualized transmitter of original sin; as ultimate guarantor of survival in the afterlife; as alternately intrinsic to and separate from gender roles; as sexually indeterminate; as an object of dissection; as entity to be manipulated by eugenics; as spectacle; as conveyor of psychological trauma; and many more. Scholars have also become increasingly aware of the more abstract uses of the body, such imagistic uses for uniting society into a corporate whole. This course considers these  perceptions through the prism of history and fluctuating theoretical perspectives.",

    "overview": "First-Year Arabic, Arabic 111, is a three-quarter sequence providing a thorough grounding for listening, speaking, reading, and writing Arabic. The course follows the integrated approach which blends the standard Arabic, Fuṣḥā, and the dialect or colloquial language, āmmiyya, in a way that reflects the authentic practice of native Arabic speakers. To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fuṣḥā.  To develop speaking and listening skills we will be using an educated spoken version of the āmmiyya of the Levantine dialect.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world.  \n\nArabic 111-1, taught in the Fall Quarter, is the first quarter of first-year Arabic.  Topics covered during this quarter are: The writing system (alphabet); the number system; and about 200 basic everyday words covering self-identification, family, work, the weather, transportation, clothing, colors, and food.",

    "overview": "This course appeals to students interested in broadening their vision of Jerusalem, the city deemed holy by the three Abrahamic religions. They will deepen their knowledge of the contested narratives of Jews, Christians, and Muslims centered in Jerusalem and the \"land called holy\" and contextualize the role of Jerusalem in shaping broad political, religious, and cultural myths. Using the methodological principle of \"history and memory,\" this course will explore the foundational texts that have shaped and continue to shape conflicting narratives of Jerusalem. Students will embark on a journey from the archaeological digs in the 10th-7th centuries BCE through the destruction of the first Solomon Temple and Jerusalem, through the Hasmonaean rebellion in 164 BCE, and Jerusalem's acquiring of a primordial place in classical Judaic and early Christian tradition in the 1st century CE. We will explore the city's transformation as the center of the Temple-based cult into the key holy locus in Jewish and Christian memory. We will focus on the earliest attempts of rising Islam to establish itself in the Judeo-Christian environment of the holy city of Jerusalem and explore the Muslim nomenclature for Jerusalem, Muslim construction on the Temple Mount, and the Arab reaction to the crusades and crusaders. \nWe will focus on the expansion of Jerusalem in the pre-independence era and the rise of the military conflict of Jordan versus the State of Israel around the post-colonial city following the termination of the British mandate, the ramifications of Six Day War for the area, the rise of the PLO, and the emergence of Jerusalem as the national capital in the second half of the 20th century. We will discuss how Jews, Christians, and Muslims negotiate sacred spaces in real life and in political charters, how and why Jerusalem became divided and what the plans of various parties are regarding the future status of Jerusalem.",

    "overview": "How do Indigenous writers use archives as a site of experimentation with artistic forms and media, from personal narrative to collage to performance to installation art?  Indigenous writers have taken on the power and histories of archives—from national libraries like the Library of Congress to small, local historical societies to anthropological repositories—and made experimental literatures that challenge these institutions of power and memory.  Examples include Pequot William Apess's 19th century texts assembled out of extracts from newspapers and testimonies from other Pequots to the Oglala Lakota poet Layli Long Soldier's intervention in legal documents at the level of the page in Whereas to Deborah Miranda's (Ohlone-Costanoan Esselen Nation of California) assemblage of personal and institutional histories in her memoir Bad Indians.  This seminar pairs Indigenous literatures with archival theory and practice. We will develop our own archival practices by learning how to work with materials in Northwestern's Special Collections, how to identify and interpret archival materials, how to develop a research question in conversation with archival research and theoretical readings, and how to develop a sustained argument with strong evidence.",

A \"classical\" work is thought to be a must-read, a foundational text that influenced the older (as opposed to contemporary or modern) ideas that undergird discipline of sociology, both the way we think about it and perform it. We will read many of them but focus mainly on Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Du Bois, exploring what they have to say about the sociological enterprise. Readings and graded assignments focus on determining these foundational disciplinary authors' (1) methods for viewing and understanding the socioeconomic world, (2) ideas about the proper objects and subjects of study and how sociology should be properly conducted, and (3) key contributions to early sociological thought. Ten weeks is a very short time to acquire and engage with this knowledge, so expect this course to be very reading and writing intensive.",

This course will explore the vibrant lives and everyday experiences of Jewish communities in the region, spanning from the 11th to the 20th centuries. Drawing on specific case studies and recent research, the course will offer a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics that shaped the relationships of Jews to their predominantly Muslim environment in premodern MENA. \nInstead of a simplistic narrative of either harmonious coexistence or constant conflict and discrimination, we will explore the intricate layers of the history of Jews in the Islamic world to reveal their intertwined world. The course does not aim to provide a comprehensive historical overview but rather seeks to illuminate critical aspects of Jewish cultural and social embeddedness in MENA through recent scholarship on key themes. These include competing and overlapping legal systems, commercial life and material culture, gender, religious polemics and intellectual exchanges, shared devotional spaces and practices, and more. The students in the course will concentrate on individual research papers based on secondary scholarship but also translated primary sources.",

    "overview": "Topic: Babylon\n\nConsidered one of the greatest cities of antiquity, Babylon was the seat of successive powerful empires, a center of culture and political power in the ancient world. And yet, no ancient city was so desired and feared, so admired and despised. Babylonian citizens saw their city as a paradise—the center of the world and symbol of cosmic harmony, while Greek historian Herodotus called it the world's most splendid city. But for the Jews, it was a city of sin and pride. For millennia, the city and the myth of Babylon have inspired artists, writers, and philosophers all over the world.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore the art, architecture, and urban history of Babylon from its foundations to the present day, as well as the artistic legacy of this ancient city in the modern world. We will survey the visual culture of Babylon in a variety of media from the miniature art of cylinder seals to the grandeur of its monuments like the Ishtar Gate. We will study the city's palaces, temples, and colossal walls as representations of imperial ideology, and inspiration for fantastic structures, like the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens. In addition to the ancient artistic legacy of Babylon, we will consider the historical and cultural memory of the city in the modern world, through grand artistic depictions since the Renaissance, and visual representations in popular culture from films to video games to sci-fi and opera. Finally, we will examine how the city and its monumental buildings were instrumentalized by Saddam Hussein as symbols of nationalism and propaganda in the 1970s and ‘80s.",

This does not mean that within capitalism there are not robust debates over how it should be run; ranging from what I might flippantly call, \"capitalism with a human face\" or \"capitalist democracy\" on one hand and \"market fundamentalism\" on the other. This era is often referred to as neo-liberal based on a certain understanding of the18th century liberalism of Adam Smith et alia. The first part of this class will be on the assumptions of capitalism and their historical roots (wealth, Christianity, profit, the market to name but a few); the opposition of Karl Marx, and the categories of Max Weber (essential for understanding the \"firm \"and authority). The second part will be the debates over the market and case studies of market failures and their social implications for people's lives. Finally, we will look at one analysis of how opposition to this stage of capitalism might look in the 21st century.",

    "overview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "overview": "What are the Seven Deadly Sins, how did they come into being, and how do can we make sense of the role they continue to play the 21st century popular imagination?  What is the nature of moral and ethical transgression:  is sin a disposition, a thought, an action, or an external force? And how does one make amends for such transgression? Over the course of the quarter, we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring the shifting representations of sin, secrets and confession that pervade late medieval literature. Analyzing the texts of preachers and poets alike, we will investigate the ways in which medieval writers adapted their depictions of sin to address the major social and political issues of their day, highlighting certain sins while hiding others as the moment required.  Along with sin, we will examine the practice of confession in its historical and literary contexts, discovering how priests, poets, and playwrights exploited and transformed this pastoral tool for narrative and social ends.  While giving students with a background in confessional practice and the discourse of Seven Deadly Sins, this course will also provide an introduction to some of the major works of the late Middle Ages: Dante's Purgatory, Langland's Piers Plowman, and Everyman. We will also explore how David Fincher's 1995 film, Se7en reworks these medieval concepts for a contemporary audience.",

Such texts and films are no longer inherently considered completely marginal, despite not yet being a major part of the Israeli culture and the literary canon. This course presents a broad examination of LGBT/queer Israeli literature and culture - from the new wave of gay and lesbian literature in the 1990s up to some more contemporary works. What stories and questions do Hebrew queer literary texts and films present? Is queerness in the Israeli context being celebrated or is it still fighting for acceptance and tolerance? Throughout the course, we will explore Israeli prose works and films that engage with LGBT/queer identities and topics, and examine questions and themes, such as \"coming out of the closet,\" \"queer identity,\" \"the lesbian continuum,\" \"heteronormativity/ homonormativity,\" and the queer notion of \"no future.\" The literary and cultural texts will be accompanied by theoretical texts from Adrienne Rich, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lee Edelman, J. Halberstam, and more. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel, or Judaism is required! All the Hebrew texts will be read in translation, and all the films will be accompanied by English subtitles.",

Scientific methods in psychology will be demonstrated through two class-wide experimental projects that illustrate basic aspects of experimental design.  Individual student reports of these projects provide instruction on scientific writing to field standard (APA) format.  Working in small groups, students will carry out an independent research project to prepare a final term paper.  In parallel with these research activities, class discussions will review experimental design and control, identifying and avoiding confounds in research, scientific ethics and contrast with non-experimental research based on correlational approaches.  Primary goals of the course are to be able to both critically evaluate scientific findings and effectively communicate the findings of their own research.",

    "overview": "This course brings a global lens to the study of Black history.  It aims to explore the various worlds and historical contexts that have shaped Black life, and it examines Black world-making over time and space.  The course begins on the African continent in the period that would set the stage for the forced migrations of Africans to Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas and moves into an exploration of how enslaved and unfree African labor became fundamental to the project of building European empires in the modern period with a focus on Britain and France.  It will look comparatively at enslaving societies and processes of emancipation in the Caribbean and Latin America and devote significant attention to the historical legacies of slavery and colonialism in Europe, Africa and the Americas.  The final weeks of the course will give students an opportunity to think about how Black populations outside of the U.S. have engaged in struggles for racial justice, citizenship and forms of Black liberation throughout the twentieth century and into the present.",

    "overview": "Nervous system function requires the generation of a vast number of neuron types and the elaboration of complex interconnections among them. This course will cover the embryological organization and cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal development. This includes neuroembryology, generation and differentiation of neurons and glia, axon guidance, experience-dependent development and plasticity, human brain development, and sex differences in development and behavior. Diseases resulting from failures of these processes will be discussed. This course will also introduce research methods and technology, and encourage students to develop skills to appreciate historical context and logical rationale of contemporary research.",

What exactly is dystopian about these worlds, as imagined?   How do the people in these worlds envision the future?   What about their ways of thinking or about their practices challenges the dystopian?  How do these dystopian worlds compare with worlds we already know, or with the way things were when these stories were written?    \n\nShort stories, novels and films may include (among others) some of the following:  Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, \"Friday Black\" or \"The Era\";  Heather Lindsley, \"Just Do It\"; Emily St. John Mandel, \"Station Eleven\";  Ted Chiang, \"What's Expected of Us\" or \"Understand\";  Kazuo Ishiguro,  \"Never Let Me Go\";  Shirley Jackson, \"The Lottery\"; Ursula K.

RUSSIAN 101-1 is the first part in a three-quarter sequence designed to get students using Russian quickly (by week 3) with fun instruction and projects (games, virtual excursions right from our classroom in Russia, cartoons, tv shows, and movies, etc). You'll be using ChatGPT, Online translators (like Google Translate, but also the better Yandex Translate), and Artificial Intelligence ChatBots (like the Russian Alice/Alisa or Алиса) to learn and practice Russian while also thinking about ethical aspects of these technologies. Emphasis is on practical communication so that students start speaking in week 3 and will be able to function in many authentic situations by the end of the quarter! Our main textbook https://mezhdunami.org/ is free and online and one of the most diverse and inclusive Russian language textbooks available today. Students will also use either the DuoLingo or Mango app for Russian (Mango is available for free to any Northwestern student through the Evanston Public Library). There is no final exam instead there is a final project.",

    "overview": "This seminar guides CLS majors through the process of writing a substantial research essay (The Senior Essay, 12-15pp) in the field of Comparative Literature. What does it mean to do \"comparative\" work? This question will animate discussion throughout the quarter, but the essay students produce for this course will be narrowly focused on a research topic in literary studies determined in collaboration with their advisors. We will read selectively about the shared enterprise of Comp Lit (its history as a discipline, its changing shape as a field of study), but the class is largely shaped by student research projects, and class time will include writing workshops. Assignments are designed to create a communal sense of professional identity, as well as develop the skills, work habits, and materials indispensable for researching and writing scholarly essays: students will produce short written texts, prepare and analyze outside readings, and do in-class exercises. The Seminar will culminate with the presentation of their research at the Senior CLS Colloquium held at the end of Fall Quarter, for a public composed of a community of peers, graduate students, advisors, and other faculty. (N.B.: The structure, components, and language of this syllabus have been adapted freely from existing syllabi for CLS 398 and ENG 398.)",

    "overview": "Topic: Romantic Obsession, Colonial Possession: Romancing 19th and 20th-Century Colonial Literature\n\nPocahontas and John Smith are making goofy, animated eyes at each other as British colonials push further into the New England interior. Outlander's Claire and Jamie steal passionate moments during the fight for Scottish independence. And when he died, David Ochterlony—British Resident to the Mughal Court in the early 1800s—left behind thirteen Indian wives. This course asks: how and why are the tropes of possessive romance so often refigured in the colonial context? What can tracing these affects, fetishes, and motifs allow us to uncover about the emotional resonances of imperialist discourse and resistance? After grounding ourselves in classic tales of romantic obsession, we will map these romantic forms onto larger concepts of empire. Edward Said described the Orientalist impulse as \"fatally tend[ing] toward the systematic accumulation of human beings and territories.\" To trace these fatal, obsessive drives to possess, we will move from classic novels like Brontë's Wuthering Heights and George Orwell's Burmese Days to shorter texts such as Clarice Lispector's The Hour of the Star and V.S. Naipaul's \"In a Free State.\" Films include Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca and Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. This course will also include readings in postcolonial and affect theory.",

    "overview": "Topic: BABYLON\n\nConsidered one of the greatest cities of antiquity, Babylon was the seat of successive powerful empires, a center of culture and political power in the ancient world. And yet, no ancient city was so desired and feared, so admired and despised. Babylonian citizens saw their city as a paradise—the center of the world and symbol of cosmic harmony, while Greek historian Herodotus called it the world's most splendid city. But for the Jews, it was a city of sin and pride. For millennia, the city and the myth of Babylon have inspired artists, writers, and philosophers all over the world.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the art, architecture, and urban history of Babylon from its foundations to the present day, as well as the artistic legacy of this ancient city in the modern world. We will survey the visual culture of Babylon in a variety of media from the miniature art of cylinder seals to the grandeur of its monuments like the Ishtar Gate. We will study the city's palaces, temples, and colossal walls as representations of imperial ideology, and inspiration for fantastic structures, like the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens. In addition to the ancient artistic legacy of Babylon, we will consider the historical and cultural memory of the city in the modern world, through grand artistic depictions since the Renaissance, and visual representations in popular culture from films to video games to sci-fi and opera. Finally, we will examine how the city and its monumental buildings were instrumentalized by Saddam Hussein as symbols of nationalism and propaganda in the 1970s and ‘80s.",

    "overview": "Medieval culture was overwhelmingly Christian, but it was heir to several pre-Christian religions. Germanic paganism brought monsters, defiant heroism, and expectation of a coming \"twilight of the gods,\" while Celtic paganism supplied magical objects and mysterious Otherworld visitors. Contrary to popular belief, the Church did not suppress the use of pagan sources, but medieval writers transformed the materials they inherited, producing sophisticated texts that present a Christian point of view layered above tantalizing and elusive pagan subtexts. In this class we'll look at (1) the Old English world of Beowulf with an apocalyptic novel based on it, Maria Dahvana Headley's The Mere Wife; (2) three tales about magical shape-shifting characters: Marie de France's Yonec, The Wife of Bath's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; and (3) the romance of the Holy Grail—a Celtic magical cauldron that evolved into a prized Christian relic. The class may also include film adaptations such as the comedy classic, Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), and David Lowery's imaginative retelling of The Green Knight (2021).",

    "overview": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners or resources. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce inequities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and planetary health. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and equitable access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19. Beatriz will not be use ungrading for this course but each student will create an assignment bundle.",

    "overview": "Yiddish, which was developed in the Middle Ages as a Judeo-German language, became the language which most Jews had spoken in East and West Europe until the Second World War. We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust. Class materials will be comprised of articles and book chapters to provide the historical, cultural, and political context of the eras we will discuss, and of essays, short stories, and poems translated from Yiddish to English. No previous knowledge of Yiddish or of Yiddish culture or history is required. All course materials will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions.",

    "overview": "Throughout the twentieth century, the terms \"urban\" and \"black America\" became so intimately connected that they are often used as synonyms. By tracing different representations of urban life, this course examines the signification of the metropolis in African American cultural production.  Although our focus will primarily center on cultural texts, we will address a number of the \"push and pull\" factors that prompted the Great Migration and the social forces that have subsequently kept many African Americans in the city. In focusing on a set of cultural texts, we will consider the ways in which African Americans have imagined both the allure and dangers of life in the city. Literature may include work by Nella Larsen, Ralph Ellison, and LeRoi Jones; artists may include the photographers Wayne Miller and Camilo José Vergara as well as the painter Jacob Lawrence; film media may include Coolie High and Good Times; music may include hip hop artists from Public Enemy to Common. Critics may include W.E.B. DuBois, St. Clare Drake, Raymond Williams, Mike Davis, and Mary Pattillo.",

    "overview": "The goal of the Statistics 420 sequence is to provide a comprehensive introduction to statistical theory and methodology at a level not requiring advanced probability theory (i.e., measure theory). Statistics 420-1 covers distribution theory. Distribution theory is concerned with probability distributions of random variables, particularly those concepts that arise frequently in statistical theory. The emphasis on this course is on the precise and careful statement of results and on the accurate determination of quantities such as moments, distribution functions, and so on, that are often used in statistical methodology. Prerequisites: A good background in calculus, real analysis (e.g., the concept of a limit), linear algebra, elementary probability theory, and statistical methods.",

But rather, this course is one that thinks black feminist—not black \"women's\"—theory and theorizing; this course chronicles the ways that the political, intellectual, ethical, and social resound radically and progressively and names that resonance—and all its vibrations and textures—black feminist theory. Thus, we will, of course, be reading a variety of black women along the jagged gendered spectrum between and beyond \"cis\" and \"trans,\" but more specifically we will, in this course, be tracing the ways radical politics and ethics arise in such a way as to interrogate the established parameters of race and gender normativity, of our social world. To do this, we will be reading the work of people like bell hooks and Patricia Hill Collins, Toni Morrison and Toni Cade Bambara, Jennifer Nash and Hortense Spillers, and more.",

And how do we make sense of sentences like \"My lawyer is a shark\", when lawyers are human, and sharks are animals? The field of pragmatics is concerned with such instances of natural language meaning that go beyond the literal, and with how speakers and hearers coordinate to communicate and derive them. Importantly, in the past two decades, pragmatics has experienced an ‘experimental turn', giving rise to a growing body of literature that examines theoretical problems experimentally, using the tools of psychology and cognitive science. This course will provide an overview of some major topics in experimental approaches to pragmatics, paying special attention to how linguistic theory can inform experimental design, and in turn, how experimental data bears in on theory.",

    "overview": "Learning Spaces, Learned Bodies\n\nThis is a College Seminar on the relationship between the body, space, and learning. While education and college are often presented as primarily intellectual activities, we will pay attention to the spatial and bodily dynamics that shape how we create, share and access knowledge. Using a range of creative assignments and multi-modal interdisciplinary sources, we will approach the body and space as places where learning happens, and therefore as categories through which we can analyze how learning happens, including in our very own classroom and on campus. Students will learn to ask how the body shapes and is shaped by its learning environment through categories like gender/sex and sexuality, race/ethnicity and religion, ability and access, and how fields like architecture, design, technology and media influence the enterprise of learning. Students will learn to re-examine their most basic assumptions about learning in a variety of expected and unexpected settings, like libraries and maker spaces, rabbinic bathrooms and football fields, science labs and ancient Greek life, in order to prepare for a range of learning experiences that they may encounter at Northwestern, and beyond. The course will guide students to be more attuned to the social and material dynamics that may otherwise go unrecognized in these experiences, teaching critical skills that will prepare them to be more conscious learners. It will appeal to students with a wide-range of academic interests across the humanities, arts and sciences, and to anyone interested in asking big questions about learning through different time periods and fields of study.",

This class is designed for students who are interested in exploring the relation between these two forms of creating, discovering, and analyzing rigorously formed structures that hover between reality and imagination.   Each student will develop their own final project in consultation with the professor.  After an introductory discussion of \"mathematicity\" (Roland Barthes) and the \"mathematical person\" (Robert Musil), the class is broken into three units.  The first considers a small number of poetic genres and individual poems whose mathematical character is a crucial element of their meaning.  In the second, we read several short stories by a single author, Jorge Luis Borges, whose \"fictions\" are widely recognized as auspicious points of intersection between literature and mathematics. In the final unit, we examine literary representations of the mathematician, ranging from Musil's sketch of a \"man without qualities\" through Benjamín Labatut's image of Alexander Grothendieck to Alice Munro's luminous portrayal of Sophia Kovalevsky at the end of her life. All readings and discussion are in English; those who know one or more of the original languages (German, French, Spanish) are encouraged to work with the texts in their original form.",

    "overview": "Why did South Asians migrate and settle outside South Asia? What are the historical origins of South Asian diasporic communities in Africa, South-east Asia, Europe, and North America? How did South Asia's encounter with colonialism affect the migration of South Asians elsewhere? In this thematic survey, we will learn about the history of South Asians' migration from the nineteenth century to the present, with special emphasis on the historical inter-relatedness of migration, colonialism, and decolonization. Our cast of characters will range from soldiers and exiles to laborers and merchants. We will traverse a diverse array of geographies, ranging from Singapore and Fiji to Uganda and Britain. We will discover how South Asian communities in various parts of the world were made and unmade by colonial economic imperatives, often exploitative trans-oceanic labor networks, and colonial categories of social identification. Instead of being erased by mid-twentieth century decolonization, South Asians' migration was reshaped by national imperatives of the ‘home' country on the one hand, and the new political and economic order of the post-World War II world on the other. \n\nThe course is divided into two parts. In Part I, we walk through the history of South Asian migration, paying attention to the changing historical contexts and causes of this phenomenon. In Part II, we dive deeper into socio-religious characteristics of South Asian migrants, such as caste hierarchies and gender relations, and examine why these features have persisted, and been reinvented in some instances, despite centuries of habitation outside South Asia.",

    "overview": "Jerusalem: History, Memory, Fantasy\n\nThis course appeals to students interested in broadening their vision of Jerusalem, the city deemed holy by the three Abrahamic religions. They will deepen their knowledge of the contested narratives of Jews, Christians, and Muslims centered in Jerusalem and the \"land called holy\" and contextualize the role of Jerusalem in shaping broad political, religious, and cultural myths. Using the methodological principle of \"history and memory,\" this course will explore the foundational texts that have shaped and continue to shape conflicting narratives of Jerusalem. Students will embark on a journey from the archaeological digs in the 10th-7th centuries BCE through the destruction of the first Solomon Temple and Jerusalem, through the Hasmonaean rebellion in 164 BCE, and Jerusalem's acquiring of a primordial place in classical Judaic and early Christian tradition in the 1st century CE. We will explore the city's transformation as the center of the Temple-based cult into the key holy locus in Jewish and Christian memory. We will focus on the earliest attempts of rising Islam to establish itself in the Judeo-Christian environment of the holy city of Jerusalem and explore the Muslim nomenclature for Jerusalem, Muslim construction on the Temple Mount, and the Arab reaction to the crusades and crusaders.\n\nWe will focus on the expansion of Jerusalem in the pre-independence era and the rise of the military conflict of Jordan versus the State of Israel around the post-colonial city following the termination of the British mandate, the ramifications of Six Day War for the area, the rise of the PLO, and the emergence of Jerusalem as the national capital in the second half of the 20th century. We will discuss how Jews, Christians, and Muslims negotiate sacred spaces in real life and in political charters, how and why Jerusalem became divided and what the plans of various parties are regarding the future status of Jerusalem.",

    "overview": "AY25: Many students find writing their own research project to be one of the big milestones of their college experience (aside from Dance Marathon and Dillo Day). This seminar aims to help you meet this milestone by completing a research paper of your own design on Asia, a paper of 12-15 double spaced pages in length. Taking your strongest seminar paper from your undergraduate career to date as a jumping off point, you will expand and develop an original argument with further research and writing - an important and necessary part of research writing that students often do not have a chance to explore in topical seminars. This class provides the space for students to read, think, and talk about their respective research methods and questions, finding references, writing and developing arguments in stages, and working through multiple drafts of writing to produce a polished research paper. Students will also have a chance to practice sharing their research findings with peers, advisors, and the university community.\n\nWhile mainly a writing-focused seminar driven by individual student projects, the course will also engage questions of how researchers from different communities and fields have sought to decolonize the kinds of knowledge they glean and produce. How might you, with your respective life experiences, positions, and interests, produce knowledge that is meaningful to you, the communities and histories at stake, and the general public?\n\nEnrollment in this course requires instructor approval (direct your inquiry to jwe[at]northwestern[dot]edu, with your reasons for wanting to take this class). While generally intended for juniors and seniors in ALC, this course is open to students of all years and majors, space allowing. Please secure a primary advisor on the field of your research prior to enrolling in this course, as you will need to consult your primary advisor on key aspects of your research project. If you intend to pursue an honors thesis project, you are encouraged to consult your primary advisor about this as early as possible. The course convenes once a week, which means that for six days of the week, your work will be largely self-guided. Your commitment to bringing materials to share and workshop each week with your peers is important to making the most out of this seminar.",

    "overview": "This course is an opportunity for students to critically examine what is often a taken-for-granted aspect of social life: gender. This course will involve learning about gender as well as applying gender theory. We will study a variety of theoretical approaches to the study of gender, with particular focus on how problems are identified and theories are developed. We will examine several emergent cases of gender theorization -- childhood gender and sexuality panics, bathroom surveillance, and the intersex experience, among others. By the end of the term, students will be able to 1) describe and compare theoretical anchors for the sociological study of gender and 2) in writing, apply gender theory to original ethnographic data. This is a reading-heavy upper division course and prior course experience in gender/sexuality studies (by way of taking Gender \u0026 Society or other course work) is strongly advised.",

    "overview": "Our world is awash in predictions: climate models and pandemic models, political polls and betting pools, economic forecasts and military scenarios, plus the ever-approaching AI utopia and/or hellscape. This is hardly new. For millennia, people have been debating what the future holds. They haven't always been right, of course, but even their mistakes tell us a great deal about the times they were made. Ironically, studying the future is an excellent way to study the past—and reconsider our present. In this course we will study 5,000 years of prognosticators, from Mesopotamian astrologers to today's climate scientists. Along the way we will read sci-fi authors and religious millenarians, socialists and Afro-futurists, eugenicists and high-tech visionaries. We will also play in-class scenario games and read Covid predictions to get a feel for how the future unfolds in lived time.  This course may not teach you to predict the future more accurately, but it will help you to better understand visions of things to come. Come explore the alternative worlds of futures past.",

    "overview": "This course examines the causes and consequences of growth and fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. We begin by reviewing existing evidence on the answers to the following questions: How important are fluctuations in the modern U.S.? Why were fluctuations larger in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century? Who gains and who suffers most because of fluctuations? How is inflation related to economic fluctuations? Why are fluctuations larger in developing economies than in developed economies? To understand the facts that we will document, we will consider modern general equilibrium theories of aggregate fluctuations. One important class of theories, Real Business Cycle theory, stresses the role of fluctuations in the rate of technology change. A different class of theories stresses the role of fluctuations in aggregate demand, including self-fulfilling changes in consumers' expectations. These theories have very different implications for optimal monetary and fiscal policy, which we will explore and evaluate. Finally, we will consider the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economy.",

    "overview": "A dynamical system is any system whose state changes according to some fixed rule. The theory of dynamical systems is relatively young in the long history of mathematical discovery and development. Its origins date to the late 19th century, but a wave of research activity since the 1970s was partially inspired by the computation and visualization abilities of emerging computer technology. \n\nThis course will focus on discrete dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. We will start with the examples of the shift map, the tent map, and the logistic family to introduce the concept of chaos, and explore further properties of chaotic behaviors through Lyapunov exponents, conjugacy, and bifurcations. Additional topics to be covered include fractals, self-similar dimensions, complex dynamics, and an exploration of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. We will also make frequent use of computation technology to augment our understanding and inspire our mathematical investigations. \n\nThe prerequisite of this course is a course in linear algebra. The course will also assume some familiarity with computer programming, and many of the homework assignments will involve simple programming in Mathematica.",

His Achilles harasses centaurs in Thessaly, has a rocky relationship with his parents, and passes as a maiden to avoid joining the war. Cut short by the poet's death, the poem leaves us to wonder how this Achilles could ever have become the Achilles of the Iliad. \nA mere book and a quarter and long neglected in scholarship, the Achilleid offers an opportunity for students to read the entire poem and develop real mastery over its contents and landmark secondary scholarship.

(Students are welcome to take one or both parts of English 270.)\n\nIn the first quarter we'll explore the history of North American literature from its indigenous beginnings—including the migration by Europeans to what they imagined as a \"new world\"—through the crisis of slavery in the mid-1850's.  We will be centrally engaged with a set of related questions: What is American literature?  Who counts as an American?  Who shall be allowed to tell their stories, and on whose behalf?  We embark on this literary journey at a moment of questioning the relations between the present and our \"literary traditions\": various organizations are debating how to commemorate the four hundredth anniversaries of the years 1619 (the year the first ship bearing enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia) and 1620 (the year of the Plymouth settlers' landing in what is now Massachusetts); at the same time, people are calling for the removal of monuments to Christopher Columbus and to the Confederacy.  We will be reading authors that canonical literary histories have usually included—Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Frederick Douglass, and Nathaniel Hawthorne—alongside Native American authors who told stories of European encounter and African American accounts that radically contest the meanings of some of the key terms of U.S. literature, history, and culture: discovery, citizenship, representation, nation, freedom.",

    "overview": "Indigeneity and Textuality in Latin America.\n\nThis course explores the notion of indigeneity and its attendant textual manifestations and representations in literary and cultural production in Latin America. First, we will consider some definitions of the term, ranging from the implicit in colonial-era texts, to the explicit in 19th and 20th century narratival and essayistic production. Secondly, we will dive into the large, diverse scholarship—much of it contemporary and ranging in origin from social sciences such as anthropology and archaeology to humanities such as history and literary studies—that has attempted to articulate indigeneity in connection to the demands of, alternately, nationalisms, vindicatory movements, social revolution, identitarian politics, and other political and cultural formations in the continent. Key amongst our considerations will be understanding not simply the shapes that indigeneity takes within these disciplinary, cultural and political contexts, but also the mechanisms that allow it to move and transform between them. We will pay special attention to the place of writing and will seek to account for the generation of indigeneity from lettered and cultural objects and their historical moments. Readings will be selected from a range of primary and secondary texts and may include Guaman Poma de Ayala, El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Popol Vuh, el Manuscrito de Huarochirí, Manuel Gamio, José Carlos Mariátegui, Fausto Reinaga, Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, José María Arguedas, Gamaliel Churata, Alison Spedding, Blanca Wiethüchter, César Calvo, Rigoberta Menchú, Marisol de la Cadena, Gonzalo Lamana, Mary Louise Pratt, Joanne Rappaport, Tom Cummins, Bruce Mannheim, Martin Lienhard, el Taller de Historia Oral Andina, and others.

    "overview": "In recent years historians have developed a new technique called microhistory for capturing the lives of the people who have been lost to history—peasants, heretics, poor women, gays, and con-conformists of all sorts. These were the people who because of their low social status, rural origins, illiteracy, or unpopular beliefs were ignored, despised, or persecuted by the dominant society. Microhistory is a method of investigation that usually relies on the evidence from judicial trials of otherwise obscure people who found themselves in trouble with the authorities. The method gives a voice to those who otherwise left no written record of their lives. The result of the studies has been a remarkable re-evaluation of the experiences and beliefs of the common people.",

What are the many promises—and what are the many pitfalls—of interracial encounters, and what do they reveal about the country writ large? How do minority writers understand and narrate each other? This class brings contemporary African American, Native American, Latinx, and Asian American literature into relation with a focus on interracial dynamics. By examining complex topics from Black/Asian conflict during the 1992 LA Riots to the shared border migrations of indigenous and Latinx subjects, we will develop an analytical framework attuned to how American racial identity has been differentially and unevenly constructed through history, culture, and politics. A central goal of the course is decentering whiteness as the primary locus of literary analysis, to allow for more nuanced interpretations of topics such as U.S. imperialism, mixed race identity, activism, labor history, and immigration. In the process, we will familiarize ourselves with the richness and diversity of multiethnic American literature by considering a variety of genres, including poetry, novels, short stories, and film.",

    "overview": "\"This course offers a study of Berlin, Germany's world-famous role as a major center of contemporary dance music (techno, house, disco) and nightclub culture. Beginning in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Berlin, the city quickly became home to cutting-edge DJs, party planners, club owners, and dancers, including notorious clubs like Tresor and Berghain. Coming together, they pioneered new ways to express oneself and connect with one another through music and dance. This course examines many aspects of this culture, from the unique genres of music and how DJs create music to the technology of sound, the experience of dancing and of clubs as spaces, and the politics of belonging, representation, and identity on the dance floor, in particular its complicated exchanges with Black communities and music in Chicago and Detroit, the birthplaces of this music. We also will consider the social, cultural, and political implications of nightlife and dance music as a site of community-building, friendship, and love within contemporary Western society, especially for queer communities. As a College Seminar, the course will introduce you to college life and the essential, but mostly unwritten, rules, expectations, resources, and habits for you to succeed as a student. This \"hidden curriculum\" will include topics such as time management, emotional health, academic integrity and the mechanics of citation, and how to seek help. Our assignments will include a variety of small, weekly writing assignments and short summative, comparative, and analytic essays to begin your familiarization with college writing. There will also be an experiential component to the course involving events with DJs in which you will talk about practical topics such as the work of DJing and making music and the politics and logistics of dance.\"",

Blending classic conceptions of personality with current research, the course considers the study of persons from three different standpoints: the person as (1) social actor, endowed with dispositional traits; (2) motivated agent, constructing values and goals; and (3) autobiographical author, creating an integrative, culturally shaped story to make sense of life. An important component of the course is applying the main ideas of personality psychology to the interpretation of a single case - the life of a famous person from the 20th century, chosen from a list of about 20 famous people.",

    "overview": "As you are well aware, being young has many benefits and many drawbacks. For instance, the optimism and creativity that often characterize youth can lead to positive social and societal change. At the same time, though, young people often struggle to be taken seriously, even when their actions and ideas are good ones. Through examining several historic and contemporary case studies, this course will explore both the triumphs and terrors of youth (i.e., teens-twenties). What risks are uniquely available to young people? Which ones are rewarded and which end in regret? How might these outcomes be mediated by other factors (e.g., race, gender, sexuality)? Most importantly, what can we learn from the triumphant and terrible behaviors of others? As we explore answers to these questions through discussion, reading, and writing assignments, we\\'ll also take advantage of your own uniquely youthful status as first-quarter, first-year students. Specifically, we\\'ll think and learn about how both your transition to college and the years ahead present you with opportunities to both capitalize on your youth and cultivate for you and others (especially those who might disparage Gen Z) a more realistic idea of what it really means to be young these days.",

    "overview": "Presidential elections are hard fought and can be controversial. In the 2020 election former Vice President Joe Biden soundly defeated incumbent president Donal Trump in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Trump, lying about the voter fraud he claims occurred, has not concede the election. In 2016 polls showed Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote yet Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012. In 2000 George W. Bush also lost the popular vote but he was ultimately chosen the victor by the Supreme Court. The fallout from the recount and the Supreme Court decision that gave Bush the victory is still being debated and studied.\n\nThis class will examine presidential elections and how they have evolved since 1952, the first year TV advertising began to have impact on the races. This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the \"YouTube\" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense \"ground game\" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages and finding a willing press that was at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage. In 2020 the country was literally plagued with a horrible pandemic, economic collapse and a reckoning regarding racial injustice.",

This course introduces an anthropological perspective to common questions, debates and assumptions about how literacy is defined and operationalized in particular contexts - and the implications for processes of world-building, social identification, schooling, and policy making. Anthropologists of literacy ask questions such as \"how is literacy defined?\" and \"who decides?\" and \"what are the consequences?\" In this course, we will consider the paradigm shifts that occurred when anthropologists of literacy questioned the oral/literate dichotomy; interrogate widespread assumptions about the meaning and value of various types of literacy practices; and become familiar with ethnographic approaches to investigating how people interact with and make meaning out of particular literacy events and practices. This course will be of interest to students in anthropology, education, social policy, and questions of equity and access.",

    "overview": "Originating in Slavic words for forced labor, the term \"robot\" evokes for many an image of blocky metallic humanoids beeping their way through a set of tasks.  Yet robots also carry the specter of revolt. We tend to fear the automated tools we design to mechanize labor, even as we continue creating more of them.  In this class, we will investigate U.S. popular culture's treatment of robots from early cinema's \"mechanical men\" to the modern controversy over generative AI.  Along the way, we will survey U.S. law's responses to the spread of technology, with particular attention to the problems raised by cutting-edge innovations like self-driving cars and AI-generated artwork.  We will read fiction by Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, and Naomi Kritzer; analyze films like The Iron Giant and The Stepford Wives; and engage with the work of scholars like Donna Haraway, Dennis Yi Tenen, Scott Selisker, and others.  By the end of the course, students will develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to fear robots and what that fear obscures about them (and us).",

    "overview": "What is \"affect theory\"? What is \"the history of emotions\"? This course charts seminal theoretical approaches to literary and cultural analysis through the lens of emotion and affect theory. Beginning with post-Freudian psychoanalysis, the class considers how subjectivity and attachment are staged in theory, literature, and film. Is affect merely an expression of contained, individual inner states? How do emotions form and mediate the subject's relationship to the world? How can we read for emotion in aesthetic form? In response to questions such as these, the class will consider together connections between emotion, aesthetics and ethics also by examining the ways in which this relationship is staged in different media from the scene of the \"talking cure\" to the \"transmission of affect\" through literature.",

I hope the area is sufficiently rich to be worth our while! The idea is for you, the students, to explain small(ish) pieces of the story in your presentations, as outlined below.  Together we will try to connect these parts.\n\nThe rough plan is this. Each student will give roughly 25 presentations, limited in length to 30 minutes.  (The decreasing function 25/n may be an inducement to recruit friends, just sayin'.)  Each student will be required to ask or answer at least one question each class.  These questions and discussion will comprise the other 20 minutes, some before and some after the presentation.\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of possible topics, with some references.  Each could accommodate multiple (many!) presentations.\n\n* Differential equations with regular and irregular singularities; monodromy and Stokes phenomena.

Beginning with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798 and ending with the country's occupation by the British in 1882, this course will trace Cairo's cultural transformations through close attention to a range of objects and sites—paintings, political cartoons, urban monuments, museums, world's fairs, architecture, and scientific illustration—produced at the nexus of Franco-Ottoman rivalry and cooperation. This course challenges conventional binaries of East vs. West, traditional vs. modern, and local vs. global by exploring art's active roles in shaping urban life across these two cities. Special attention will be paid to the transcultural formation of national, racial, gender, and sexual identities.",

What is the connection between self-knowledge and self-care? How can self-knowledge contribute to a good life?",

We were strangers once, too.\" This hostility has obscured the complex reality of the lives of immigrants.  In this course, we will study fiction and poetry by immigrants and their children in order to understand that complex reality. We will explore such questions as: How do social attitudes and institutions impact the lives of immigrants as they seek to pursue the \"American Dream\"?  What happens to the relationships between parents and children through the process of acculturation into American society?  How do differences in national origin connect with other differences, particularly gender, race, ethnicity, and class?",

    "overview": "Since H.G. Wells's unnamed time-traveler first rocketed forward to the distant future, time travel has been a favorite thought exercise for writers, day-dreamers, and artists. What does it mean to fantasize about the future and to reimagine the past? How does time travel undercut or complicate commonplace linear narratives, progress narratives, or coming of age stories? In this course, we'll investigate the genre as a way into thinking about the fundamentals of literary analysis and methodology. We'll combine readings of literary classics like H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895) and Marghanita Laski's forgotten The Victorian Chaise-Longue (1953) with selections by modern sci-fi writers like M. John Harrison and N. K. Jemisin. We'll also consider mixed-media additions to the canon, including the anime The Girl who Leapt Through Time (2006) and the movies Interstellar (2014) and Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). Together, we will confront questions about cultural difference and blur the boundaries between \"past,\" \"present,\" and \"future.\"",

    "overview": "Practical Rhetoric is a discussion-based course that explores the practical skills and pedagogical theories behind effective peer-to-peer tutoring in writing centers. The course is practical in that it is designed to prepare incoming tutors for their work at the Writing Place. This course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing engaging with those methods in your work at the Writing Place, Practical Rhetoric seeks to prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process. In the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a short writing assignment the first week of the quarter. You will continue to reflect on your learning in Practical Rhetoric and on your experiences working at the Writing Place in a series of weekly tutor journals. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research proposal, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. And at the end of the quarter, you'll bring everything you've learned together to articulate your personal tutoring philosophy.",

    "overview": "This seminar will explore some classics of fantasy literature by diverse writers, asking what's at stake when an author decides to create a new world. How do the challenges and opportunities afforded by fantasy differ from those of the realistic novel? How have writers used this genre to experiment with new social arrangements and technologies, alternative ways of imagining gender, and beliefs about the supernatural? Why do animals and monsters play such important roles? Is there a clear dividing line between \"adult\" and \"young adult\" fantasy? The objectives of the course will be to gain a fuller understanding of this genre and to develop skill and confidence in interpreting literary texts, both orally and in writing. Texts may include Hope Mirrlees, Lud-in-the-Mist (1926); Madeline L'Engle, A Wrinkle in Time (1962); Italo Calvino, The Castle of Crossed Destines (1969); Ursula K. Le Guin, The Compass Rose (1982); Salman Rushdie, Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990); Philip Pullman, The Golden Compass (1995); and G. Willow Wilson, Alif the Unseen (2012).",

    "overview": "This class is an introduction to political ecology, a multidisciplinary body of theory and research that analyzes the environmental articulations of political, economic, and social difference and inequality. The key concepts, debates, and approaches in this field address two main questions: (1) How do humans' interactions with the environment shape power and politics? (2) How do power and politics shape humans' interactions with the environment? These questions are critical to understanding and addressing the current issues of climate change, neoliberal capitalism, and environmental justice. Topics discussed in this class will include environmental scarcity and degradation, sustainability, resilience and conservation. Readings will come from a variety of disciplines within the social sciences and humanities. Case studies will range from the historical to the present-day. No prior background in the environmental sciences is needed to appreciate and engage in this course.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "overview": "This course will give students a basic grounding in the class of statistical techniques known as multilevel modeling (MLM). MLM deals with \"nested\" data structures. This is a common situation, such as when measurement occasions are nested within people, when children are nested within classrooms, or workers nested within companies. MLM goes by other names as well, such as hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), mixed effects models, random coefficient modeling, and random effects models.  These techniques have been applied to many different research questions within the biomedical, behavioral, social sciences, and even engineering.  We will focus on MLM as it is used in behavioral and social science research, with examples from education, lifespan development, and emotion research.  Specifically, we will discuss in detail the three main types of multilevel models that are used in the social sciences:  1) the clustered-observations or organizational models (e.g., children nested within classrooms), 2) growth-curve or traejctory models (e.g., estimation of change with measurements nested within people over months or years), and 3) within-person variation models (daily or hourly measurements nested within people over days or weeks).  Students will also learn how to use SAS Proc Mixed for conducting MLM analyses, and we will touch on using R for MLM as well.  Students are assumed to have taken at least two graduate statistics courses and have a solid understanding of regression analysis.",

How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward. We will read the novel in English; no prior knowledge of Spanish or Spanish literature is needed.",

    "overview": "AY25: The aim of this course is to introduce the histories of feminisms and feminist consciousness in the Sinosphere, and to thus provide students with exposure to non-Western-centered cases of feminist struggles for human rights and social justice from the late nineteenth century to the present. To achieve this goal, we will analyze a variety of sources, including literature, films, and other media by authors and activists concerned with the lives and realities of Chinese women. In the course of our discussions, we will map our respective positionalities vis-à-vis the study of feminist engagements, histories, and actors in the Sinophone.\nThroughout the quarter we will combine our engagement with primary and secondary sources to navigate questions like: How do we study feminisms within the remit of Chinese studies? What biases, legacies, and challenges do we need to contend with as scholars working (mostly) in the Anglophone outside of the Sinosphere? Who determines when and where Sinophone feminist engagements emerged? What disciplinary methodologies and tools do we have in our interdisciplinary toolbox that we can deploy as researchers and as teachers?\n\nWe will be joined in this enterprise by two exciting and distinct cohorts both virtually and in person. A series of guest speakers based in the USA, Europe, mainland China, and Taiwan who, in their roles as scholars and activists, will help us probe the contested claims about the births and birthplaces of Chinese feminisms, to engage, critique, and discuss both conventional and alter/native approaches to studying and teaching Sinophone feminisms in the Anglophone. We will thus have the opportunity, to engage in a dialogue with scholars like Barbara Mittler, Wang Zheng, Jia Tan, and others. For each of these lectures, we will share a virtual synchronous classroom with fellow classmates in Heidelberg University, who will attend an intensive version of this course over Summer 2024, also taught by Professor Zamperini. Our learning will thus help us build a collective, transcultural, and global community of thinkers and researchers, one that helpfully will continue long after the end of our course at the end of the Fall quarter.\n\nKnowledge of Chinese and previous exposure to the course's topics, while helpful, is not required.",

    "overview": "Why go to college? To become educated? To stay up all night thinking deep thoughts? To prepare for a career? To party? Is college a straight and narrow path through requirements and electives to graduation, or is the story more complicated, more open-ended? What happens when the story ends (or doesn't end) at graduation? Does attending college even matter today? The stories we tell about the college experience shape our expectations and our experiences at a university - as do current debates about the value of a liberal arts education.\n\nCourse Goals and Objectives: To get you thinking critically about why you chose Northwestern and what you hope to achieve here; to hone your close reading skills by examining contemporary texts (fiction, non-fiction essay) that tell different stories about college; to understand today's debates about the liberal arts; to introduce you to new ideas about how to learn and thrive in college; to think critically about the transition into Weinberg College, Northwestern, and its resources; to hone your skills as a writer of college-level work. Optimistically: as we think our stories about a/the College Experience, you will begin to write the story of your own.",

One aim of the course is to examine various methodological approaches to embodiment and materiality, making use of sociology and philosophy (Pierre Bourdieu, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Baruch Spinoza, and Bruno Latour).  The second and closely related aim is to situate bodies in time and place, that is, in history.  Here we look to the particular circumstances that shaped the manner in which historical actors experienced their bodies in the Christian west (Peter Brown, Mary Carruthers, Michel Foucault, among others).  Ultimately, we will be examining theoretical tools while we put them to work.  The goal: how to use these theorists to write more dynamic, creative, interesting scholarship?",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

In this college seminar, we will enact the concepts of love and care as a way of thinking, being, and relating to others. We will draw from queer, trans, feminist, disabled, neurodivergent, and anti-racist approaches to explore the potential of love, critical hope, and solidarity in our everyday lives. Our classroom will be a space to understand love's powerful potential in education, interpersonal relationships, social change, and more. Together we will develop strategies to help us care for ourselves (emotionally, physically, and mentally) and build meaningful connections with others, which will create a strong foundation for thriving as a college student and beyond.",

Our goal is to think critically about the materials and the periods studied, while also strengthening oral and written Spanish skills. We will balance close readings with discussions on larger issues, such as indigeneity, colonialism, the limits of historical representation, and the emergence of continental and national identities. Prerequisite (may be taken concurrently): SPANISH 200-0 or 204-0.",

    "overview": "Athens was a renowned center of politics, art, religion, and culture throughout antiquity, and even today many of the ancient city's archaeological features remain as prominent landmarks. This course will examine the topography, archeology, and history of Athens from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period. In particular, the course will explore how ancient Athenian notions of identity, nationalism, and aesthetics were formed, perpetuated, and challenged through the city's rich material footprint and urban development. We will ask questions including: How did the religious, political, and social topographies of the city interact with one another? How did certain spaces develop over time to suit the city's changing needs? How were canons of aesthetics formed and integrated into the city-state's fabric? In this course, we will also survey Athenian funerary and festival practices, discuss cultural institutions like the theater and the gymnasium, and examine how Athenian gender norms were reflected in material culture. Finally, we will discuss the benefits and limitations of material culture as evidence and how Euro-American receptions of Athens have shaped the field of Classics (the issue of Atheno-centrism).",

    "overview": "Throughout the twentieth century, the terms \"urban\" and \"black America\" became so intimately connected that they are often used as synonyms. By tracing different representations of urban life, this course examines the signification of the metropolis in African American cultural production.  Although our focus will primarily center on cultural texts, we will address a number of the \"push and pull\" factors that prompted the Great Migration and the social forces that have subsequently kept many African Americans in the city. In focusing on a set of cultural texts, we will consider the ways in which African Americans have imagined both the allure and dangers of life in the city. Literature may include work by Nella Larsen, Ralph Ellison, and LeRoi Jones; artists may include the photographers Wayne Miller and Camilo José Vergara as well as the painter Jacob Lawrence; film media may include Coolie High and Good Times; music may include hip hop artists from Public Enemy to Common. Critics may include W.E.B. DuBois, St. Clare Drake, Raymond Williams, Mike Davis, and Mary Pattillo.",

    "overview": "The U.S.-Mexico border was first envisioned in writing when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) imagined the course that a new dividing line would run: from the Gulf of Mexico through the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande until the town called \"Paso,\" west toward the Gila River and onto the Pacific Ocean. This line would mark not only land and water but also racial and ethnic formations. Indigenous nations saw their territories split in half by a border that considered their homelands wilderness. Mexicans who found themselves north of the imagined line had to grapple with a new vocabulary to define themselves as they lost their lands to settlers. Those who ended up south of the border attempted to reconcile their recent independence from Spain with the loss of half of the country as they, too, tried to piece together a narrative for their new identity. This course will walk students through the text and maps of the 1848 treaty and the literary works that continue to process its aftershocks throughout the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Some of the authors we will read include Chicana theorist Gloria Anzaldúa, Laguna Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko, and Mexican writer Yuri Herrera. We will learn about the discourse of Manifest Destiny, the Chicano Movement, and contemporary literature from Latinx, Indigenous and Mexican writers who continue to tell the stories about their ancestral lands, their migration journeys, and their encounters with a line that became both border and borderlands.",

    "overview": "From the crafty protagonist of the medieval Romance of Reynard to Sonic the Hedgehog's bestie Tails, pop cultural foxes have delighted us for centuries. In this course, we'll zero in on this particular species to think about bigger questions: what makes an animal an animal and a human a human? Why do people like to read and write stories starring nonhuman characters? And what can we learn about real foxes from imaginary ones? During the quarter, we'll encounter a variety of fictional foxes in books and movies, including George Saunders's novella Fox 8, Wes Anderson's adaptation of Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the 1973 Disney animated film Robin Hood. And we'll think about animals more broadly (what it's like to be one, and how humans interact with and think about other species) through science writing, philosophy, and creative nonfiction, material that will help us analyze our primary sources. Using this array of texts, we'll think about why and how we use writing and imagination to understand experiences and perspectives radically different from our own. Through peer review and group discussions, we'll practice reading critically to identify a writer's objectives and to assess how well they're achieving them (this includes you!). Most of all, this class is intended to help you develop a personal writing process that's useful, practical, and even fun, with the hope that doing so will serve you not just in your other classes but in the rest of your life, too.",

    "overview": "To be \"healthy\" is a complex obstacle course that many individuals living in certain bodies have to navigate. Black bodies, for example, are often the tied to (un)health because they are stereotyped as in need to be controlled, managed, and \"guided\" into healthfulness. In the U.S., these narrow stereotypes are just a few of the ways Black bodies get defined. In this course, we will move beyond those restrictive stereotypes, guided by questions such as, \"How does culture define health?\", \"How does the food pipeline affect the health of certain bodies?\" and \"What does it mean to live in an obesogenic environment?\" In this course, we examine the connection between health, culture, food, and environment with a focus on what is silenced and what is loud when generating \"fixes\" for \"diseased\" bodies. Silence refers to the disregard and dismissiveness of the narratives and experiences around the oppressions attached to the health of certain bodies. Yet, this silence echoes as Loud when connected to their culture, food, and environment when discussing diseases highlighted in Black bodies such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.",

While studying the language, students will be constantly exposed to the Italian culture. By the end of the intensive sequence, students are expected to achieve language, cultural, and intercultural competence enabling them to study in Italy and to embark on the minor or major in Italian. Intensive Italian classes are small and highly interactive.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

It aims to explore the various worlds and historical contexts that have shaped Black life, and it examines Black world-making over time and space.  The course begins on the African continent in the period that would set the stage for the forced migrations of Africans to Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas and moves into an exploration of how enslaved and unfree African labor became fundamental to the project of building European empires in the modern period with a focus on Britain and France.  It will look comparatively at enslaving societies and processes of emancipation in the Caribbean and Latin America and devote significant attention to the historical legacies of slavery and colonialism in Europe, Africa and the Americas.  The final weeks of the course will give students an opportunity to think about how Black populations outside of the U.S. have engaged in struggles for racial justice, citizenship and forms of Black liberation throughout the twentieth century and into the present.",

Students will have a chance to apply insights from the readings - about histories of racial segregation, reproductive politics, militarization, and police powers - to the more recent past.

During the quarter, we will be considering these plays in their Early Modern context—cultural, political, literary and theatrical.  We will focus centrally on matters of performance and of text.  How is our interpretation of a play shaped by Shakespeare's various \"texts\"— his stories and their histories, the works of his contemporaries, the latest literary fashions, and the various versions of his plays that circulated among his audience?   Similarly, how do the details of a given performance, or the presence of a particular audience, alter the experience of the play? To answer these questions, we will consider not only the theaters of Early Modern England, but also recent cinematic versions of the plays, and we will read only our modern edition of Shakespeare but also examining some pages from the plays as they originally circulated. Our readings may include Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Merchant of Venice, Othello, Macbeth, and the Tempest.",

Students will have a chance to apply insights from the readings - about histories of racial segregation, reproductive politics, militarization, and police powers - to the more recent past. Lectures and readings cover all world regions: Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, North America, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans.",

We will map out, assess, and explore ideas about race, gender, and sexuality concerning sound through listening and readings from sound studies, queer of color critique, feminist theory, music studies, media studies, and Latinx studies. By taking an interdisciplinary approach to Latine sound studies, we will explore how sound shapes our understanding of the world around us and what important intellectual and political questions are emerging for Latine/a/o at this moment.",

We will also spend much time examining how educational experiences and opportunities are shaped by multiple social statuses including gender, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity. We will focus on K-12 and higher education including the transition to higher education. Throughout all of these issues and topics, we will consider how schools both challenge and support existing systems of inequality.",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

First, we will examine how the process and structures of representation and American Elections. Then, we will investigate the contributions of key political actors to campaigns: parties, interest groups, and the media, and they interact through elections. Finally, we will examine voter perceptions of parties and campaigns, and how voters are targeted (or not) by political actors. The class will focus on critical political science articles (and can follow along with the text) to investigate these topics.

    "overview": "Very broadly, feminism is both a political movement and a theoretical commitment to ending gender-based oppression. Feminists have contributed important work to every area of philosophy, posing distinctive questions and developing distinctive critiques, views, and concepts. In this course we will learn about feminist contributions to various \"core\" areas of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and social philosophy. Issues we may consider include: ‘what is gender?' (metaphysics), ‘how does gender impact our standing as knowers' (epistemology), ‘how do and how should gender norms operate in our moral theories?' (ethics), ‘what are sexism and misogyny, and how can we counteract them?' (social philosophy). We'll also think about the commitments, assumptions, and aims shared by feminists across philosophy and what it is that connects this work across philosophy.",

What makes someone a true friend, how many kinds of friendships are there, and how many friends should we aim to have? These kinds of questions preoccupied ancient Greek philosophers, and their contributions to these topics continue to influence contemporary thought. We will investigate different proposed answers to these and other questions with a view to better understanding ancient Greek ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. This course strongly emphasizes the development of close reading and writing skills. No prior exposure to ancient philosophy is required.",

    "overview": "As our 21st-century human lives become increasingly enmeshed with technology, Prometheus Bound, performed in Athens about 2,500 years ago, offers a defamiliarizing lens to reflect on the role of artefacts in human societies. The tragedy dramatizes the conflict between Zeus, newly installed ruler of the gods, and the Titan Prometheus, dispenser of fire and inventor of all human techniques. As Prometheus gets brutally bound to a rock at the edges of the world, then gradually imagines a way to negotiate his freedom, Prometheus Bound offers \"one of the greatest plays about tyranny and oppression that the theater knows\" (R. Rehm), as well as a study in empathy, and a demonstration of the powers of human language and intellect. Its original production would have amounted to a spectacular performance, complete with a flying entry by the river Oceanus, a virtuoso piece of solo dancing by the cow-maiden Io, and a terrifying earthquake. We will read most of the tragedy in Greek and discuss its significance in its original fifth-century BCE context, when architects, sculptors, potters, and doctors came to play an increasingly important cultural and social role in Athens.",

We will review the history of investments from early civilization to present day with a focus on the cornerstone advancements over the last 80 years. In conjunction with this work, we will study the evolution of investment theory with the goal of having students understand basic investment concepts. We will also survey the major investment categories with a focus on how investing takes place in the \"real world\" with leading investment professionals as guest lecturers.\nThe hope is that the class will stimulate an interest in/passion for investing, provide students with the tools to begin to build their own framework for future investing, and provide an overview and insights into the investment profession.",

Why? This course will attempt to answer this question by examining several failed and continuing disease eradication efforts through a multidisciplinary lens. Case studies will include smallpox, malaria, polio, measles, and hypothetical emerging infectious diseases. We will examine the grandiose global health goal of total disease eradication in relation to sociopolitical realities that limit the applications of idealized technological interventions.",

Working in small groups, students will carry out an independent research project to prepare a final term paper.  In parallel with these research activities, class discussions will review experimental design and control, identifying and avoiding confounds in research, scientific ethics and contrast with non-experimental research based on correlational approaches.  Primary goals of the course are to be able to both critically evaluate scientific findings and effectively communicate the findings of their own research.",

    "overview": "Worlds of Literature\n\n\"World literature\" has been one of the most influential and controversial ideas in literary studies in recent decades. Some champion it as a liberation from the provincialism of national and/or Euro-centric canons and methods. Others critique it as the cultural analog of imperialism and capitalist globalization, leveling diverse and incompatible oral and textual traditions into something recognizable as \"literature\" in a few \"major\" languages.\n\nIn this seminar we will read about a variety of ways of conceiving the \"world\" of world literature. After considering some of the most influential and canonical models in recent literary studies (Damrosch, Casanova), we will study a variety of alternative forms of literary world-building, such as Soviet internationalism, transnational Black solidarity movements of the early twentieth century, and script-worlds (such as the Sinosphere). Our readings will range from classic theoretical texts by Herder, Kant, and Marx to publications from the past two or three years (Nergis Ertürk, Madhumita Lahiri, Musab Younis), by way of such major contemporary critics and theorists as Emily Apter, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Pheng Cheah, Fredric Jameson, Lydia Liu Amir Mufti, and Roberto Schwarz.",

We will begin in the present and work our way backwards, looking first at the impact of globalization on the conditions underlying art making, exhibiting and viewing. Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life.  \n\nNo prerequisites.

At the end of the full 102 sequence (102-1,2,3), students are expected to create with the language when talking and writing about familiar topics, to understand the main ideas and some supporting details from a variety of texts (newspaper articles, short stories, …), to describe and narrate, with some consistency, in all major time frames while organizing their discourse into paragraphs. Students will significantly increase their knowledge of Italy's history and culture. After the completion of the entire sequence of Italian 102, students will be eligible to study in Italy and will be ready to embark on the minor or major in Italian. The second-year Italian course sequence completes the two-year WCAS language requirement. The classroom is very lively, with lots of conversation, partnering, and small group exercises. Students will be guided toward independence, posing and solving language problems on their own and in collaboration with classmates.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

    "overview": "Intermediate Italian continues and completes the two-year sequence in Italian language and culture. At the end of the full 102 sequence (102-1,2,3), students are expected to create with the language when talking and writing about familiar topics, to understand the main ideas and some supporting details from a variety of texts (newspaper articles, short stories, …), to describe and narrate, with some consistency, in all major time frames while organizing their discourse into paragraphs. Students will significantly increase their knowledge of Italy's history and culture. After the completion of the entire sequence of Italian 102, students will be eligible to study in Italy and will be ready to embark on the minor or major in Italian. The second-year Italian course sequence completes the two-year WCAS language requirement. The classroom is very lively, with lots of conversation, partnering, and small group exercises. Students will be guided toward independence, posing and solving language problems on their own and in collaboration with classmates.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

In this quarter, we delve deep into the fundamentals of Python for data science, focusing on essential libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, students will gain proficiency in data manipulation, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within datasets. Students will learn how to use statistical measures and visualization tools to uncover insights, identify outliers, and detect patterns in data.\n\nStudents may not receive credit for both this course and STAT 301-1.",

Taking an interdisciplinary approach drawing on the social sciences and global/public health, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, practices and forms of knowledge production characteristic of what we call \"global health\" today, exploring the environmental, social, political and economic factors shaping patterns and experiences of illness and healthcare across societies. We will scrutinize the value systems that underpin specific paradigms in the policy and science of global health practice, and place present-day developments in historical perspective. As an introductory course on global health, the class delves into comparative health systems, including in high- and low-income countries. Key topics will include: policies and approaches to global health, key actors in global health, comparative health systems, structural violence, gender and reproductive health, chronic and communicable diseases (including pandemics), politics of global health research and evidence, and the ethics of global health equity.",

Students will build their vocabulary and further develop all language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. We will work with a modern blended textbook, and a variety of authentic materials. Most of the class time is devoted to practice in conversation, role-play, and discussions. This course is a firm foundation for more advanced courses, as well as great preparation for students going abroad. In addition to learning about Russian culture in daily life, students will explore Russian literature and art, and a professional guide will take us on a virtual tour of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. \nBy the end of the year students are expected to advance to the Intermediate Low/Intermediate Mid proficiency level (ACTFL scale).",

    "overview": "Title: \"Mathematics on Screen, Big and Small\"\n\nDescription: Mathematics is everywhere, even on the big and small screens. Film and television have sought to incorporate mathematics and the doers of mathematics into their storylines much over the last few decades, in films such as Good Will Hunting, A Beautiful Mind, and Hidden Figures, and television shows such as Numbers and The Big Bang Theory. Were these attempts successful? Did the mathematics introduced make sense in context and add to the experience? For that matter, what were the underlying mathematical concepts mentioned in the first place?\n\nThis seminar will explore the use of mathematics in film and television. We will learn something about the math involved, touching on areas such as graph theory, game theory, topology, and dynamics, and evaluate how mathematics is portrayed in media in general. Only minimal background in mathematics (at the level of pre-calculus) will be expected.",

It adopts an interdisciplinary framework for understanding Islam as a lived tradition by focusing on the debates and practices that have animated Muslim religious life across time and geography. We will examine religious texts alongside material evidence, historical research, and ethnographic studies. Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which Muslims have engaged with the Qur'an and the life and legacy of the Prophet Muhammad, the practice of Islamic ritual, piety, and devotion, as the place of Islamic law in everyday life. Through this course, students will develop critical vocabulary necessary for understanding Islamic discourses and practices, as well as facility with the theoretical language in the study of religion.",

One aim of the course is to examine various methodological approaches to embodiment, materiality and affect, making use of sociology and philosophy (Pierre Bourdieu, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Spinoza, Massumi). The second and closely related aim is to situate bodies in time and place, that is, in history. Here we look to the particular circumstances that shaped the manner in which historical actors experienced their bodies in the Christian west (Peter Brown, Caroline Bynum, Mary Carruthers, Michel de Certeau, Michel Foucault). Ultimately, we will be examining theoretical tools while we put them to work. The goal: how to use these thinkers to write more dynamic, creative, interesting scholarship?",

    "overview": "Originating in Slavic words for forced labor, the term \"robot\" evokes for many an image of blocky metallic humanoids beeping their way through a set of tasks.  Yet robots also carry the specter of revolt. We tend to fear the automated tools we design to mechanize labor, even as we continue creating more of them.  In this class, we will investigate U.S. popular culture's treatment of robots from early cinema's \"mechanical men\" to the modern controversy over generative AI.  Along the way, we will survey U.S. law's responses to the spread of technology, with particular attention to the problems raised by cutting-edge innovations like self-driving cars and AI-generated artwork.  We will read fiction by Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, and Naomi Kritzer; analyze films like The Iron Giant and The Stepford Wives; and engage with the work of scholars like Donna Haraway, Dennis Yi Tenen, Scott Selisker, and others.  By the end of the course, students will develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to fear robots and what that fear obscures about them (and us).",

While studying the language, students will be introduced to Italy and its people and they will gain both language and cultural competence.  At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs.\n\nThis course is the first in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

We begin the course by considering how to estimate the cash flows and discount rates for investment property, allowing us to estimate a property's fundamental value. We next discuss how investment property is generally financed by a close examination of real estate debt markets as well as real estate private equity. We consider the taxation of property as well as how investors should think about the risks to investing in property. We conclude with important considerations for investors when their investment thesis does not come to fruition. We will study property investment using the tools and framework of modern corporate finance and investments, while focusing on the institutional features unique to the real estate industry. As such, the course is designed for students with or without a real estate background, who may be interested in learning about investing in property, either personally or professionally.",

Law shapes our day-to-day lives incountless ways. This course examines the connections andrelationships of law and society using an interdisciplinary socialscience approach. As one of the founders of the Law and Societymovement observed, \"law is too important to leave to lawyers.\"Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical,disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology,history, anthropology, political science, and critical studies) in order toexplore the sociology of law and law's role primarily in the Americancontext. The thematic topics to be discussed include law and socialcontrol; law's role in social change; and law's capacity to reach intocomplex social relations and intervene in existing normativeinstitutions and organizational structures.  \n\nCross-listed with Sociology 206-0",

    "overview": "The emergence of Muslim politics is arguably one of the defining transformations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This course explores the diversity of the contemporary political experiences of Muslims in multiple and shifting contexts to address questions such as: what is the role of ideology and faith in Muslim politics? Where does political Islam come from? How does politics play out in the lives of Muslims? How diverse are contemporary political experiences of Muslims? How did immigration, globalization, Islamic revival and violent extremism and securitization policies reshape the political and religious landscape of Muslim-majority nations as well as in non-Muslim countries? What does the study of political Islam teach us about the relationship between religious and politics in the modern world?\n\nThe course is divided in three parts. In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact. In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. In Part 3, we examine the social, political and historical dynamics shaping the politics of Muslim minorities in Europe and the USA, including the war on terror, identity politics, racialization and islamophobia. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins.\n\nOur cross-cutting themes include state in the Muslim world, party politics, secularism, democracy, social movements, political violence, the politics of religion, security policies, globalization, citizenship, social and economic development.",

We will study artists' use of sustainable practices and reclaimed materials, the critique of spatial inequality and the space of the city itself as an artistic medium through urban farming, public art, and community engagement. Readings include theoretical and historical texts, but the primary object of study will be the artworks, exhibitions, and installations themselves. As a museum seminar, we consider the methods of institutions of different scales and types, including alternative galleries and artist-led projects, as they collect and present work by contemporary and historical Black artists. Students must be able to attend site visits that will often extend 1-2 hours past class hours on Fridays because of transportation time.",

    "overview": "AY25: This course examines the relationship between arts and politics in modern Japan. We will examine examples of how art has been conceived as a form of political activism and how social movements have, in turn, shaped cultural and aesthetic forms. The course will move chronologically while exploring a set of historically persistent questions: How have art and politics been defined as distinct or overlapping realms of human activity? What is the relationship between aesthetic form and political ideologies? How is artistic production itself a form of social organization and engagement? We will consider, among other topics, how transnational anarchism and struggles for democracy in the late 19th century shaped the modern novel; feminist literature and proletarian arts movements; fascist aesthetics; practices of democracy in the postwar avant-garde; afro-Japanese solidarities and cultural exchange; the intersection of art and social protest in the 1960s; and the role of the arts in anti-nuclear movements. Drawing from an array of disciplinary perspectives, this course investigates how the arts have been used to imagine and enact social change on local, national, and global scales.

The course examines the emergence of new leisure forms, sites, and practices and probes how local, regional, and global events shaped the cultural life of both Jewish and Arab societies and their intercultural relations. Throughout the course, we will discuss cafés, cinemas, beaches, nightlife, theatre, and sports venues as spaces of both intercommunal encounters and friction. We will examine how broad historical processes such as modernization, urbanization, the emergence of national identities, and the evolving national conflict between the Arab and Jewish communities shaped local leisure patterns. Also, we will analyze the interrelationship between leisure and other social constructs such as work, family, community, and nation. How did categories of ethnicity, gender, and class organize and reshape institutions and practices of leisure culture and vice versa? The course combines a wide range of primary sources as well as cultural products of Jewish and Arab writers, moviemakers, and artists. Through course readings, lectures, discussions, and collaborative assignments, students will confront the many ways in which leisure had a foundational impact on ordinary people's daily lives and the formation of collective identities in 20th-century Palestine \\ Israel.",

The course will examine the general properties of biological clocks and will analyze how biological clocks are used to time a number of diverse activities at the level of the cell, the organ, as well as the organism.  Special emphasis will be placed on the neural basis for the generation of circadian rhythms and on the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.  The importance of biological rhythms for human health and disease will be covered in this course.  Much of this course will involve the analysis and discussion of classic and recent experiments that have been carried out in the study of biological clocks and the control of the sleep-wake cycle.

    "overview": "In the era of Snapchat and TikTok, epic has entered the urban dictionary.  As the genre of what Milton called \"heroic song,\" though, epic predates even the invention of writing, and is perhaps the oldest form of poetic production.  What has allowed such epic success?  The persistence of epic through cultural and linguistic change is one of the form's central themes: how can words heroically uttered and deeds heroically dared be passed on from one lifetime to those that follow?  How are they transformed?  What does it mean to take up as one's own something that has been passed down from a culture no longer present?  Such questions become even more pressing in moments when one culture encounters another and in its new context must confront what to retain, what to adopt, and what to invent.  In this course we will consider how epic narrative projects, recalls, and reworks its history as tradition.  Benefitting from several recent translations of epic poems by women, we will consider the role of gender in epic.  Finally, we will look at contemporary epics that push back against the histories that have often been associated with the genre and find new themes in the form.",

Hebrew 121-1 in the Fall is the first quarter of second-year Hebrew. Students will continue with the textbook they had in the previous year (\"Hebrew From Scratch\"), a familiarity which will ease the return to Hebrew after a long summer. \n\nThe purpose of Hebrew 121-1 in the Fall is to bridge between the first year/ novice level and the second year/ intermediate level. Students will review materials from the previous year while expanding their vocabulary and learning new material such as the past tense and its forms - the binyanim (pa\\'al, pi\\'el, hif\\'il, etc.). Students will also learn conjugations of basic prepositions, and the compound form (smichut). Through engagement with a wide variety of cultural materials such as the TV series \"Shtisel\", the reading of a graphic novel, songs, and newspapers, students will have opportunities to delve into the nuances and complexities within Israeli society. Class consists of exercises, discussions, presentations, and group/ partner work.",

    "overview": "This is a studio course which will approach drawing as a viable medium for the gonzo journalist or the amateur snoop. Students will engage in obsessive, idiosyncratic surveillance on a topic of their own choosing and generate speculative sketches, diagrams, other types of drawing and handwritten commentary. Potential topics for investigation could relate to the personal, popular culture, the everyday, politics, and/or the world but must be approached with a particular point-of-view, or several. To that end, students will experiment with narration and degrees of omniscience, objectivity and reliability. Readings and conversations on artists and writers who work with unreliable narration, diagramming, handwriting and the diaristic will also be a part of the course. There will be group discussions assessing smaller exercises and a group critique on one final, long-term project, an obsessive investigation. Art majors, art minors and non-art majors are welcome to enroll. While no prerequisite is required, students should enter into the course with a serious interest in sleuthing, drawing, writing, narration and a willingness to embellish the truth.",

    "overview": "The American courtroom has provided a venue through which Americans have grappled with moral panics, political tensions, celebrity scandal, and mass violence. The high-profile prosecutions of people ranging from Lizzie Borden to OJ Simpson had a powerful hold on American culture at the time. And although these trials rarely had a significant effect on the law, they remain potent cultural touchstones, their stories told and retold through movies, television shows, podcasts, songs, and souvenirs.\n\nThis course examines several famous American trials—famous both in their time and today—to understand and examine key themes in American political, legal, social, economic, and cultural history. We will focus largely on the twentieth century—a period of multiple \"Trials of the Century\" —to see how each trial crystallized broader political and social tensions over ethnicity, gender, race, religion, politics, sexuality, and social status. Each trial combined elements of both formal law and public theater; through these trials, we'll examine the relationship between legal reasoning and storytelling. We will also examine how and why we return to such stories; how do they endure in historical memory, and what tensions do they help us think about today?",

    "overview": "Is war among the major powers inevitable? For much of modern history, the major powers have fought numerous wars for territorial and economic gains, to settle grievances and past wrongs, or to advance their status. By contrast, the post WW II era marks the longest period in which no major power war has occurred. How was that possible? And will this \"long Peace\" last?\n\nThe course will take both a contemporary as well as a historical look at how states have constructed rules of the game to facilitate trade, foster peace, and engage in cultural interaction. We will first look at various explanations of why major power wars occurred, and then turn to different perspectives of how international systems and international societies can be managed. We will consequently study Western as well as non-Western systems.\n\nIn the first part of the course, we will read various theories regarding the likelihood of major power war or high level of armed conflict. After that you will have the option of choosing between various modules that focus on a given regional area or topic. Some of the modules take a historical approach that might reveal a variety of modes of how stable orders might be created. For example you could examine how the Chinese tributary system maintained stable relations with some states for centuries without much conflict. Or you could analyze how international relations might be understood in the Islamic world. More broadly one might study whether different conceptions of international relations can be reconciled. Overall the objective of the course if for you to develop your own perspectives and expectations regarding how the international system might evolve in the future and to think about topics that dovetail with your specific interests for the final essay.",

    "overview": "The Moroccan scholar, Abdellah Kaaouas has dedicated a book to \"errance,\" one of the \"corner stones\" of Abdelkebir Khatibi's work. Indeed, through the motif of \"errancy,\" Khatibi converses with multiple traditions of literary and philosophical writings across time. Figures such as the translator, the voyager, the mystic, the knight, the artist lie at the core of his literary work as well as his writings on literature, ethics, and politics. For instance, in Figures de l'étranger dans la littérature française, he speaks of literature's \"l'exotisme du dedans,\" as that which renders all literature \"étrangère à elle-même et à son cadre national et patriotique.\" This figure is encapsulated for Khatibi that of the « exote » in Victor Segalen's work which he analyzes in the first chapter of this book (12). \n\nIn this course, will turn to works from the corpus of Francophone African literature through the motif of \"errance.\" We will trace and reflect on the modalities of errancy as movement across time and space as well as its association with \"error\" and \"going stray,\" given its derivation from the Latin \"errare.\" We will start with one of the most errant works of world literature, A Thousand and One Nights, learning about its history, modality of narration, and influences on contemporary works. We will then turn to works that directly engage with Nights tracking its appropriations and reimaginings. Finally, we will explore works that do not explicitly respond to or rewrite Nights but nevertheless foreground errant dynamics that may be informed by our reading of Nights.\n \nWhile this course builds on the theoretical insights of French 432 taught in spring 2024, it is designed to be self-contained and is, therefore, open to all interested students able to read and discuss in French at the graduate level. Suggested readings will enable students to deepen their background as needed.",

    "overview": "The New Testament has influenced the lives and experiences of individuals and communities across the globe for thousands of years. It has served as a source of structure, meaning, and hope for many while also influencing ideologies and practices of bigotry and violence. But what do we really know about the world in which the New Testament was produced? What was the project of Jesus and his followers and why was it so polarizing? What authors composed the New Testament's texts and what can we glean about their audiences and motivations? Why were some texts chosen for the canon of the New Testament and others left out? \n\nThis course will consider the New Testament from a range of vantage points. We will use historical methodologies to explore the complex networks of religious practices, cultural ideologies, and political actors that influenced its production. We will also consider how the New Testament has been read and reproduced in the past 2000 years. We will discuss a range of theological perspectives, analyze the impact of the New Testament on art and literature, and assess its role in global politics. Students will be exposed to interpretations of the New Testament from the perspectives of eco criticism, queer theory, disability theory, and liberation theology, among other critical lenses.",

Thus, understanding the generation, propagation, and transfer of electromagnetic radiation forms the basis of most astronomical research. This course aims to help students develop the theoretical background and tools needed to model and interpret astronomical observations. Through lectures, problem sets, in-class discussions students will learn how radiation is produced by and interacts with matter and then apply this knowledge to a capstone research project",

Together we'll analyze theatrical revolutionary Bertolt Brecht's landmark early twentieth-century adaptation of Marlowe's play and its \"alienation effect,\" twentieth-century productions and films of Marlowe tied to the early gay-liberation movement (Ian McKellen) and the early AIDS crisis (Derek Jarman's), and twenty-first century rewritings, including a companion play that incorporates figures in/against queer culture from Gertrude Stein, Harvey Milk, and Julie Andrews to Margaret Thatcher (Tom Stuart's play After Edward). We'll conclude with the recent gay rom-com \"Red, White, and Royal Blue.\" Critical readings will delve into the history of sexuality, queer readership and book history, and theories of dramatic adaptation and performance.",

    "overview": "In this course we will analyze canonical political theoretical texts in conversation with contemporary U.S. jurisprudence and politics, paying special attention to themes of sovereignty, nationalism, war, the rule of law, speech, sex, race, religion, and resistance. The objective is for students to acquire the knowledge and competencies of a responsible citizen. This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for supporting, challenging, or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, and Carole Pateman. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The authors assigned for this class wrote in very different times and contexts, and had different political priorities. Each week please reflect on whether the author's objective is a state with a primary goal of institutionalizing ideas about nationality; a state with the overriding objective of institutionalizing justice, or thwarting injustice; or a state whose power is instrumental to protecting individuals' safety, property, or flourishing. Which author's commitments and aspirations do you find most inspiring and most objectionable?",

    "overview": "This class seeks to unpack the ways in which ordinary Americans experience race in various facets of American Life.  This serves the purpose of unpacking the distinctions between race, culture, and ethnicity so that we can critique the role race plays in spaces such as the workplace, schools, military, and even our personal relationships.   It also serves the purpose of assisting us in being able to discern the meaning of actions between groups along lines of race, class, gender, and sexuality.\n\nThis class takes a backwards glance at understanding racial perceptions and policy through a rather unlikely but well-documented event in recent US history, a hurricane.  Though, not just any hurricane.  The social impact of Hurricane Katrina, which occurred nearly 20 years ago, in New Orleans also had implications for the US nationwide.  We will look at the impact that the media coverage of Katrina had on popular culture, education, sports, and social policy.  The legacy of Katrina is inextricably bound with that of race.  The class will use Katrina as a case study to understand the real consequences of one of our nation's most divisive and destructive social ideas, some might even say an illusion…race.",

    "overview": "AY25: Although episodes of religious violence are still met with incomprehension and bafflement, even a cursory reading of world history would remind us that religion's power to inspire violence is not only not new, but it is pervasive. This course investigates the intersections between religion and violence in the context of Buddhist Asia while also considering why in many religious traditions there seem to be a link between the two. The course will be structured in two parts: in the first part students will be encouraged to build expertise in the basic concepts, definitions, and general academic consensus (as well as debates) about categories including \"religion,\" \"violence,\" \"sacrifice,\" \"ritual,\" \"martyrdom,\" and also \"nationalism,\" \"politics,\" and \"terrorism\" through reading both primary sources (in English translation) and secondary sources (scholarly writings). We will then move into an analysis of case studies that focus on specific circumstances where Buddhist rhetoric, scriptural authority, and religious practices have played a role in violence including suicide, terrorist-related actions, and self-immolation predominantly in pre- and modern Asia. Some of the provocative questions that this course asks include: Why and how is religion involved in politics? Is Buddhism a pacifist religion? How does religion rationalize violence? How can some Buddhist leaders embrace terror as a political tool? Are the recent practices of self-immolation in Tibet acts of violence? Can non-violence be violent?",

    "overview": "Colonial Korean Literature \u0026 Culture\n\nAY25: Why is the Korean-Japanese relationship so strained to this day? How might we think about the colonial period (1910-1945) on the Korean peninsula from our present, and about intra-Asian colonialism?\n\nThis introductory course offers students some snapshots of colonial era Korean literature and culture and tackles difficult but rewarding questions about this period. We will read short fictions from prominent authors of the time and discuss visual cultures (illustrations, art, films) surrounding New Woman, Indigeneity, race, and wartime mobilization. The course also invites students to consider the often-forgotten Korean diaspora and migrations created under the vast Japanese empire that exceed the limits of the peninsula: what does it mean to be \"Korean\" in the shifting identities of the colonized in these different places around the empire? Finally, the course examines more contemporary representations of the colonial period to think about how the colonial period haunts the present as we desire and consume the colonial.\n\nNo prior knowledge of Korean language or culture is necessary to take this course. Course assignments include a deconstructed paper (short writing exercises), a group presentation, and a final creative group project. Participation in class discussion and peer collaboration are important aspects of this course.",

    "overview": "Course Topic: Underlying Conditions: Race, Health, Medicine\n\nRace is socially constructed—but how is it medically constructed? This seminar surveys Black, Latinx, Asian,and Indigenous American literary and cultural production to question how \"healthy\" bodies in the United States are constituted, and in turn, what these racialized processes reveal about the essential role of race in producing a body politic. Concomitantly, we will also read scholarship from ethnic studies that charts racialized comorbidities, pre-existing conditions, and environmental racism, as well as work that expands our understanding of race's imbrications with medical paradigms such as eugenics, genetics, informed consent, reproductive rights, disability, mental illness, and, of course, pandemics.\n\nIn addition to excavating the long histories and present problems surrounding medical racism, another goal of this course is tracking the medicalization of race itself. As such, we will challenge commonly held perceptions of bodies, pain, ability, and the constitution of equitable futures. We will also supplement our reading with guest lectures from medical professionals working at the intersection of race and medicine.Students will take away from the class a deeper grasp of the discourse surrounding race and medicine, as well as how to deploy this knowledge in their critical interpretations of cultural production. Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do texts by writers of color challenge normative assessments of what constitutes health and wellness? How do we ethically consider race and medicine without resorting to postracial idealism? And to what extent can creative experiments generated in art and literature re-envision the medicalized terms under which race is understood?",

Why is there a patron saint of stomachaches?  \n \nThis course explores the complex relationship between saints and their bodies in Christian history. Saints have long represented the extremes of Christian excellence, in large part because their lives and bodies interrogate the boundaries between heaven and earth, spirit and flesh, masculine and feminine, holy and transgressive, life and death. Saints facilitate incredible miracles, perform painful and sometimes disgusting acts of asceticism, and experience mystically erotic relationships with the divine. Even as saints live to deny their bodies, their bodies are nevertheless foundational to their sanctity, both before and after death. In this class, we will explore how and why certain exceptional individuals came to be regarded as saints; the ways in which the body was central to living a saintly life and maintaining a connection to the world after death; how religious communities developed around saints and the body; how saints used their bodies to serve their broader communities; and how ideas about sainthood, sanctity, and the body developed in relation to changing cultural movements, social interests, and local ideals. Our class will explore case studies from the ancient to the modern world, with a special focus on the middle ages.  \n\nCounts towards Religion, Health and Medicine (RHM) and Religion, Sexuality and Gender (RSG) religious studies major concentrations.",

    "overview": "Following Beyoncé's iconic call to action, this course takes a look at a number of \"single ladies\" - and a few who managed to \"put a ring on it\" - in literature, film and TV from the last two hundred years. Together, we will investigate archetypal figures of femininity, from the spinster to the madwoman to today's \"girlboss.\"  How do our literary and popular media construct and deconstruct these categories at different moments in history? Pairing feminist theory with primary texts, we'll ask: how does marriage function to resolve class tensions? How does it construct and enforce constructions of race and gender? And how, according to these texts, can women find social, emotional and financial independence? Texts may include selections from Jane Eyre, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, A Room of One's Own, Conversations with Friends, Sex and the City, and The Bachelor.",

At the beginning of the term, students will complete a needs assessment to determine which aspects of spoken English are most critical for current communication skills. These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

How do we know that tests like the n-back task, implicit association test, or fMRI studies produce evidence about memory, implicit attitudes, or emotional states? Psychologists appeal to tools of scientific reasoning, such as validation, construct development, and operational definitions, to evaluate when methods provide evidence about the objects of inquiry.   We will analyze these tools as well as typical methods employed in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. These methods include: introspection, comparative animal research, controlled lab experiments, and functional neuroimaging. Using this analysis as background, we will evaluate particular cases of scientific reasoning about animal cognition, implicit bias, short-term and spatial memory, and moral judgment. At the end of this course, we will evaluate the role of replication and integration of results in producing knowledge about the mind/brain.",

It follows the long representational career of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II (c. 1592): from Holinshed's Tudor-era chronicle history and other \"pre-texts\" through Shakespeare's adaptation/revision/rewriting in Richard II, to the emergence of the theatrical-alienation effect in Bertolt Brecht's early twentieth-century translation/adaptation Leben Eduards des Zweiten, twentieth-century productions and films tied to the early gay-liberation movement (Ian McKellen in repertory as both kings) and the early AIDS crisis (Derek Jarman and \"New Queer Cinema\"), to contemporary re-writings -- Tom Stuart's play After Edward; a German opera that weaves together antisemitism and homophobia; the recent rom-com \"Red, White, and Royal Blue.\" Critical readings in the history of sexuality, queer theory, \"source\" study, history of the book, adaptation theory, theory of tragedy, critical race studies and casting, and performance studies.",

This course will explore the vibrant lives and everyday experiences of Jewish communities in the region, spanning from the 11th to the 20th centuries. Drawing on specific case studies and recent research, the course will offer a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics that shaped the relationships of Jews to their predominantly Muslim environment in premodern MENA.\nInstead of a simplistic narrative of either harmonious coexistence or constant conflict and discrimination, we will explore the intricate layers of the history of Jews in the Islamic world to reveal their intertwined world. The course does not aim to provide a comprehensive historical overview but rather seeks to illuminate critical aspects of Jewish cultural and social embeddedness in MENA through recent scholarship on key themes. These include competing and overlapping legal systems, commercial life and material culture, gender, religious polemics and intellectual exchanges, shared devotional spaces and practices, and more. The students in the course will concentrate on individual research papers based on secondary scholarship but also translated primary sources.",

    "overview": "This course covers basic concepts in Inorganic Chemistry. It is designed to introduce students in key subjects which are used over and over again in chemistry and uses inorganic chemistry systems to illustrate the concepts. The course covers the donor-acceptor concept, hard-soft acids-bases, advanced concepts of basicity and acidity and acid-base view of salvation phenomena. The course also delves into introductory solid state chemistry including unit cells and the structure of simple solids, structure types and electronic structure and Band Theory (with the aim of understanding properties). \n\nA certain fraction of the time is also devoted to descriptive chemistry which utilizes the concepts learned in the first part of the course and the focus is generally on main group chemistry. This includes the chemistry of hydrogen and the chemistry of the elements of Group 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.",

    "overview": "Yiddish Literature and Culture in the 20th Century\n\nYiddish, which was developed in the Middle Ages as a Judeo-German language, became the language which most Jews had spoken in East and West Europe until the Second World War. We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust. Class materials will be comprised of articles and book chapters to provide the historical, cultural, and political context of the eras we will discuss, and of essays, short stories, and poems translated from Yiddish to English. No previous knowledge of Yiddish or of Yiddish culture or history is required. All course materials will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions.",

    "overview": "Psychology has traditionally focused on understanding mental illness, rather than factors that lead to optimal mental well-being. This seminar will instead focus upon the questions asked within the growing science of positive psychology. What is happiness? Can happiness be learned, or is our happiness \"setpoint\" mostly determined by genetics? Do we know ourselves well enough to know what makes us happy, and if not, why not? Does money make us happy? Relationships? Life challenges? How do people create a sense of meaning in their lives? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? How do we, as a society, encourage generosity and altruism? Students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and book chapters, will write discussion questions and take part in team exercises relevant to theory and data pertaining to positive psychology, will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply the findings of positive psychology in weekly well-being exercises, and will design their own positive psychology intervention. Students can expect to wrestle with some of the \"big questions\" about what makes a good life and a strong society in discussions with their classmates.",

    "overview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "overview": "This course surveys some of the major cultural innovations and historical processes in ancient Africa, from the advent of agricultural societies to their descendant civilizations, peoples, and societies in the Nile Valley, Western Sudan, and Central Sahara, the Rainforest of West Africa, and the East African Coast. The topics include major cultural innovations and historical milestones in ancient African history and their relevance to the contemporary world. The course mostly covers the period before 1500. Among the topics awaiting our inquiry are the impacts of climate change on agricultural innovations at the onset of the Holocene period; the philosophical, religious, social, political, and economic foundations of ancient African civilizations; and the changes and continuity in Africa's cultural history. Throughout, the instructor will emphasize the impacts of geography, environment, and global interactions on the unfolding of African history. The class will also use the concept of \"intercommunication zone\" to explore the different regional and subcontinental networks in African history.",

    "overview": "The materiality of art is central to how art is made, how it looks, what it means, and how it is preserved. Art history's recent material turn has challenged art historians to look beyond the fine arts to material culture while also expanding the field's geographic and temporal focus. However, this trend in scholarship obscures art history's long tradition of object-oriented study. This seminar examines this historiographic tradition while also looking towards current theoretical approaches to materiality, including, but not limited to, theories of agency (the means through which objects shape human behavior), making (the processes of creation, the transmission of artistic knowledge, and the global movement of makers), exchange (the movement of objects through space as they are gifted, purchased, sold, or simply used), and matter (the physical substances that comprise all objects).",

In this course, students will continue developing the four skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and learn various aspects of Japanese culture and society through readings, videos, written assignments, and in-class activities.\nThe emphasis will be on developing the skills necessary to describe not only their own experiences and daily lives, but also their community, general trend, and what is happening in society, while increasing vocabulary and sentence structures that they can use more precisely. Students will also practice summarizing a story that they heard, read, or watched. Careful and thorough review and preparation for each class session are expected. With consistent oral and written feedback from the instructor, students will enhance their language and cultural awareness, leading to increased understanding, appreciation, and utilization of the target language, to become autonomous learners.",

    "overview": "Errancy, Writing, and Francophone African Fiction\n\nThe Moroccan scholar, Abdellah Kaaouas has dedicated a book to \"errance,\" one of the \"corner stones\" of Abdelkebir Khatibi's work. Indeed, through the motif of \"errancy,\" Khatibi converses with multiple traditions of literary and philosophical writings, as well as across time. Figures such as the translator, the voyager, the mystic, the knight, the artist lie at the core of his literary work as well as his writings on ethics and politics. In this course, we will both read Khatibi through this lens and expand our scope by turning to the corpus of Francophone African literature broadly to trace and reflect on the modalities of this dynamic's inscriptions and its association with \"error\" and \"going stray,\" given its derivation from the Latin \"errare.\" As a point of departure, we will explore one of the most errant works of world literature, A Thousand and One Nights to understand its history, modality of narration, and influences on contemporary works.",

    "overview": "Refashioning the conventions of poetry, Dante (1265-1321) used the account of his presumed journey through the three realms of the Christian afterlife - Hell, Purgatory and Paradise - to explore the world at the close of the Middle Ages. The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of the Divine Comedy's cantos in their cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante fashioned the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible to craft his dream of universal peace. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Comedy and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.",

We will learn to recognize the ways in which speech sounds pattern in language to convey meaning, and the ways in which these patterns are similar and different across the languages of the world. Finally, circumstances and time permitting, we will also learn about current speech technology as it applies to computerized speech synthesis and speech recognition.",

    "overview": "In the United States, we often talk about Latinx people using blurry labels. We discuss the Latino vote, the Hispanic population, and the Latinx community. This course explores the nuances of these labels through stories narrated by Latinx authors. As we follow characters through conflicts and inhabit their quotidian lives, we will navigate between the specificity of a story and the complexity of a Latinx identity. Class discussions will study emotional ties to language, feminist thought, Latinx Indigeneities, and queer storytelling. Our readings will alternate between short stories, poetry, non-fiction writing, and one novel. As we move between forms and genres, we will pay particular attention to what Latinx authors achieve by choosing to tell their story in a poem, a short story, an essay, or a novel, as well as what each of these forms asks of us as readers. A nine-week course cannot do justice to the rich genealogy of Latinx writing. This course follows an illustrative sample of Latinx authors from the 1980s to the present. It aims to provide students with a historical, political, and literary foundation for further exploration of Latinx literature. (Taught in English)",

    "overview": "First-Year Arabic, Arabic 111, is a three-quarter sequence providing a thorough grounding for listening, speaking, reading, and writing Arabic. The course follows the integrated approach which blends the standard Arabic, Fuṣḥā, and the dialect or colloquial language, āmmiyya, in a way that reflects the authentic practice of native Arabic speakers. To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fuṣḥā.  To develop speaking and listening skills we will be using an educated spoken version of the āmmiyya of the Levantine dialect.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world.  \n\nArabic 111-1, taught in the Fall Quarter, is the first quarter of first-year Arabic.  Topics covered during this quarter are: The writing system (alphabet); the number system; and about 200 basic everyday words covering self-identification, family, work, the weather, transportation, clothing, colors, and food.",

    "overview": "Formally, economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends. Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. Picking up where macroeconomics left off, this course will introduce the principles of microeconomics and teach you how to apply these concepts to real world scenarios. Thus, this course is aimed not only at potential economics majors, but also at any student who desires the ability to understand the popular press, critically analyze government policies, and use microeconomics to make better choices as a consumer, producer, representative, or voter.",

We will visit the library the week before classes start and this research will form the basis of the seminar course during the quarter.

Through employing various exhibition methods, in this video-based studio course students will explore how context and form influence both a viewer's experience and a video's meaning. We will watch works in different sizes and shapes, in different venues. We'll watch bootlegs and degraded copies, to see how our perspectives shift. We will make work for different screens, sometimes multiple screens at once, and watch our work in a variety of contexts. Methods of instruction include lecture, discussion, readings, screenings, technical assignments, an individual project and a final group exhibition in Kresge Hall. Prior experience with digital editing suites like Premiere Pro is welcomed but not required.",

    "overview": "This course draws on perspectives from anthropology, related social scientific fields, and the humanities to explore the role of the arts and media narratives in shaping politics and experiences of mental health and illness around the world. We will consider forms of storytelling—including literature, film, and theater—across eras and cultures, tracking shifts in perspectives on normality and pathology and their consequences for the most vulnerable. How does the power of Western psychiatry intersect with that of global media to reinforce reigning paradigms and imperatives for how suffering is to be understood, classified, and experienced? Conversely, what counter-narratives are being produced by artists and their communities? What role can the arts play in individual and collective forms of healing—or in exacerbating pain and grievance? What kinds of voices seem to have power, and which are neglected? Where is the line between cathartic and exploitative representation of trauma and mental illness? How, in short, do the stories we tell about mental illness \"get under the skin\" and shape forms of suffering and care?",

Through the next 10 weeks we will explore this question and gain a better understanding of what makes something culturally significant and the laws and policies that govern cultural resources. Cultural Resources Management (CRM) is concerned with traditional and historic culture including archaeology; architecture; language; cultural landscapes; sacred sites; ecosystems; mortuary practices; ethno-biology; oral and intangible culture and history; intellectual property rights; enforcement and monitoring of preservation laws and policies; and can also encompasses contemporary culture. This Course will follow the development of the preservation movement and policy in the United States, with comparisons to other countries including Britain and Peru. We will examine the role of the industrial revolution in the creation of national preservation policies and ideas of national identities, and how the later influenced policies and enforcements. We will examine congressional acts ranging from the 1906 Antiquities Act, 1916 National Parks Act, to the 1978 Archeological Resource Protection Act, 1990 Native American Graves and Protection and Repatriation Act, Traditional Cultural Properties and Landscapes, and National Heritage Corridors. We will discuss the ethics and moral decision making that goes into these laws and the issues that arise with legislation and enforcement of cultural preservation.",

    "overview": "This course offers an introduction to Buddhist history, culture, philosophy, and practice. We explore the major doctrinal varieties of Buddhism, from its inception through the rise of the Mahayana and Tantric or Vajrayana traditions. At the same time, we also investigate Buddhist visual, material, and ritual cultures—which offer windows onto aspects of Buddhism as a lived religion not always visible in scriptural sources. In the process we engage themes like the meaning of suffering, the cosmology of cyclical rebirth, the social role of monasticism and its intervention in traditional family structures, the place of women and gender in Buddhism, the relationship between religious ideals and everyday life, the question of self-reliance versus divine assistance, and the power of images and icons. Our readings of primary sources offer close engagement with Buddhist ideas and practices, allowing us to understand how the religion shaped the ways people in pre-modern Asia saw and interacted with their worlds. Readings in secondary scholarship help us set these materials in historical context and connect them to the bigger picture of Buddhism's spread across Asia.",

    "overview": "The United States is currently home to 5% of the world's population but 25% of its incarcerated population. With close to 2 million people under the control of the American criminal legal system, the United States has more total people who are incarcerated than any other country in the world. Moreover, the United States has one of the most punitive approaches to criminal justice, imposing lengthy prison sentences, forcing people who are incarcerated to spend years—sometimes even decades—in solitary confinement, and providing very few educational, vocational, and recreational programs in prisons.  \n \nPunishment and incarceration also disproportionately impact people of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. While Black Americans and Hispanics make up about 32% of the US population, they constitute 56% of the incarcerated population.\n \nThis course will use a philosophical lens to examine the causes and consequences of this crisis of mass incarceration in the United States, along with possible solutions to it, with a particular emphasis on the theories of punishment grounding our criminal legal system and, thus, our prisons. The course will include students from the Evanston campus and incarcerated students in the Northwestern Prison Education Program. \n\n*Note: This course will take place inside Sheridan Correctional Center in Sheridan, IL. On class days, students will leave Evanston at 8 AM and will return by 3:30 PM. Enrollment is limited to 10 students from Evanston, is by permission only, and requires an application. \n\nIn no more than 500 words each, please respond to the following two questions:\nWhat do you think you would contribute to a class of this kind?\nWhat do you think you would gain from a class of this kind?\nPlease submit responses to Professor Jennifer Lackey at j-lackey@northwestern.edu by May 31, 2024. Admissions decisions will be made by June 10th.",

Students in this course will read Tibetan literature in English translation along with secondary sources to learn and reflect upon the long history of Tibetan literature up to the present. Given the impact that religious concerns have had among Tibetans for centuries, in the first part of the course students will analyze the ways in which Buddhism and Tibetan literary forms are intertwined from the Tibetan imperial period forward. The second part of the course will survey modern and contemporary Tibetan literature and its myriad influences, such as Chinese literary and political theory. Students will gain familiarity with diverse genres of Tibetan literature in translation including fiction, poetry, biographies, and historical treatises.",

How do these categories reflect, inflect and inscribe inequality as well as group consciousness, struggle, and everyday life? What are the mechanisms that maintain racial inequalities? How have Black populations questioned, practiced, analyzed, embraced, and struggled with and against these categories and their effects.  These questions guide our reading of texts from the fields of political science, history, law, anthropology, and sociology, among others. The readings address the topics of race and Blackness, politics, culture, class, place, social movements, gender, sexuality, and inequality.  Emphasis will be on empirical explorations of Black communities and the societies in which they are embedded, both inside and outside of the U.S. Each class session will involve brief introductory comments by the professor, and then in-depth discussion lead by assigned facilitators.",

    "overview": "What's So Special About Nanomaterials?: \n\nOver the past 20 years, nanotechnology has been a booming area of research in chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, and medicine. Modern techniques have allowed scientists to better study small materials, and the nanotech we read about in science fiction novels can now become real products found in our world. In this seminar, we will discuss what is so special about the size range of 1-100 nm (the nanoscale) and why particles of this size have a such a unique niche in nature and technology. We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology. As we look to future applications, we will debate the implications of these materials on the environment, human health, and safety. Regulatory bodies in the United States and around the globe have discussed the ethical and social impact of nanomaterials, and we will investigate their role is assuring the nanomaterials we use leave a positive impact on the world.",

RUSSIAN 101-1 is the first part in a three-quarter sequence designed to get students using Russian quickly (by week 3) with fun instruction and projects (games, virtual excursions right from our classroom in Russia, cartoons, tv shows, and movies, etc). You'll be using ChatGPT, Online translators (like Google Translate, but also the better Yandex Translate), and Artificial Intelligence ChatBots (like the Russian Alice/Alisa or Алиса) to learn and practice Russian while also thinking about ethical aspects of these technologies. Emphasis is on practical communication so that students start speaking in week 3 and will be able to function in many authentic situations by the end of the quarter! Our main textbook https://mezhdunami.org/ is free and online and one of the most diverse and inclusive Russian language textbooks available today. Students will also use either the DuoLingo or Mango app for Russian (Mango is available for free to any Northwestern student through the Evanston Public Library). There is no final exam instead there is a final project.",

The focus will be on the practical skills and knowledge required to design and teach a successful undergraduate course in psychology. Many of the assignments for this course are designed to result in material that can be used in a professional teaching portfolio when applying for faculty positions. Topics will include course design and creating an effective syllabus; methods of assessment; grading and feedback; writing and delivering engaging lectures; leading meaningful class discussions; designing and evaluating activities and assignments; building more inclusive classrooms; and working with challenging students. In this course, students will develop and articulate their own statements of teaching philosophy; create a course syllabus; observe and evaluate classes taught by master teachers; create exams and assignments; and practice giving lectures. We will focus on practical issues that commonly arise in undergraduate psychology courses and best practices for teaching difficult concepts in psychology. This course is meant to compliment other resources available on campus, such as those offered by the Searle Center. All course readings will be available on Canvas.  This course will meet once per week. This course is graded on a pass/fail basis. First-year graduate students may not register for this course.",

    "overview": "Physics 130-1-03 is a special \"true beginners\" physics class. It is intended for students who have had zero physics experience. Enrollment for this section is by permission number for this reason. \n\n\nThis is the first quarter of a three-quarter, algebra-based physics course with lecture. Physics is the most basic of the sciences, dealing with the behavior and structure of matter. Lectures illustrate physical principles: mechanics, motion, momentum and energy, fluids, and oscillations. It continues as PHYSICS 130-2, 3. Students taking this course must also enroll in a Physics Lab 136-1. Actual demonstrations of many physical principles will be shown in the lecture whenever possible. Weekly quizzes emphasize problem solving. The goal of the course is for the student to gain an understanding of the nature of the physical principles which govern the world around us and the universe beyond, through models which draw on our everyday experiences. Topics: 1. Motion in One Dimension 2. Vectors 3. Motion in a Plane 4. Particle Dynamics 5. Work and Energy 6. Conservation of Energy 7. Conservation of Linear Momentum 8. Collisions 9. Rotational Kinematics 10. Rotational Dynamics and Conservation of Angular Momentum 11. Oscillations 12. Fluids.",

    "overview": "Social networks have a profound effect on what you feel, think, and do. Whether or not you get a job, who will date or marry, whether or not you'll catch a contagious disease are all affected by the social networks in which you live. This class explores the ways our social networks shape society, and how society shapes our social networks.\n\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a theoretical perspective and a set of methodological techniques. As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among social actors. This approach views the social world as patterns or regularities in relationships among interacting units and focuses on how such patterns affect the behavior of network units or actors. A \"structure\" emerges as a persistent pattern of interaction that can influence a multitude of behaviors, such as getting a job, income attainment, political decision making, political activism, parenthood, the spread of infectious diseases, and so on. As a methodological approach, SNA refers to a catalog of techniques steeped in mathematical graph theory and now extending to statistical simulation, and algebraic models. This course surveys the growing field of Social network analysis.",

The course is organized around several key terms central to social movements in the United States across this historical period including: \"free love\", \"sexual freedom\", \"sexual liberation\", \"revolutionary love\", and \"safe(r) sex.\" Our goal in this course is to explore each term in its historical moment, including the social movements that rallied around these formulations, and the theories of sex/gender/sexuality being forged, recuperated \u0026/or revised as part of this process. This course is also intended to introduce students to the practice of archival research and assignments will focus on collective research projects using pre-selected materials \u0026 curated collections.

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry—including description, rhetoric, story and song—and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

Mixing memoirs and biographies with short fiction, journalism, historical studies, and university data, we will review the entry of various historically underrepresented groups of students into higher education, from Jewish, Irish, and low-income white students in the early 20th-century to growing numbers of women and Black students in subsequent decades, to openly gay and lesbian students, Asian Americans, and Latinos more recently. In addition to reading about the lives of such students, we will consider how they helped change the universities, and explore the ideas and pressures that motivated university leaders to diversify higher education, and limits to those efforts. Northwestern alumni and administrators will be invited to join us to discuss their relationship to this history, and when possible we will focus on Northwestern while putting it in the context of larger trends. The hope is that this course will introduce students to their new college and help them feel empowered and at home here, wherever they may be coming from.",

    "overview": "This course offers students tools for thinking in a critical and comparative way about the intersections of religion, law, and politics from a global perspective. Much ink has been spilt considering and reconsidering definitions of religion, secularism, and politics, and how these concepts work to shape each other and the worlds we inhabit. This course asks, what comes next in the study of religion in politics? What does it look like to not only globalize this question by asking about a wider diversity of contexts and histories beyond Europe and its settler colonies but also to interrogate, and even move beyond, vocabularies that have framed and limited discussions of these questions for decades? This transdisciplinary seminar is an experiment in thinking the question of religion and politics in modernity anew. Themes to be considered include sovereignty, governance, coloniality, borders, Indigeneity, human movement, race, and law. Graduate students in politics, history, anthropology, political theory, religious studies, performance studies, theater, rhetoric and public culture, and affiliate disciplines are welcome.",

It is designed to introduce students in key subjects which are used over and over again in chemistry and uses inorganic chemistry systems to illustrate the concepts. The course covers the donor-acceptor concept, hard-soft acids-bases, advanced concepts of basicity and acidity and acid-base view of salvation phenomena. The course also delves into introductory solid state chemistry including unit cells and the structure of simple solids, structure types and electronic structure and Band Theory (with the aim of understanding properties). \n\nA certain fraction of the time is also devoted to descriptive chemistry which utilizes the concepts learned in the first part of the course and the focus is generally on main group chemistry. This includes the chemistry of hydrogen and the chemistry of the elements of Group 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.",

    "overview": "The focus of this graduate level class will be on \"WHAT\" information is acquired using modern measurement tools in Chemistry, less on the \"HOW\" the measurements work, and the importance of effective visualization with the help of modern software for the purpose of communication. The students will use data provided to them or their own research data for assignments or the final project. The starting point is \"what question are you after?\" and \"what chemical system?\", and next, what measurement tools they wish to use or learn about.\n\nWe will cover a variety of techniques and spectroscopic methods, including X-ray Crystallography, Micro Electron Diffraction, Hyperfine EPR of Paramagnetic Solids, Single Particle Imaging by Cryo-EM, Solution and Solid-State NMR of Structure and Dynamics, Structure of Disordered Systems by Dipolar EPR, Quantum Sensing, as well as Computational Approaches and AI-Based Tools. This course will place a strong emphasis on learning visualization software for analyzing crystals, polymers, and proteins, along with Scientific Illustration Software.\n\nThe learning outcome goals are:\n\n1. Increase knowledge about state of the art measurement tools available to enhance our understanding of the chemical system of study.\n2. Gain confidence and knowledge to initiate useful state of the art measurements, including how to get help and who to ask.\n3. Enhance skills to analyze and interpret complex data to gain a clearer \"picture\" of their chemical system.\n4. Gain skills to present complex data in visually compelling ways.\n5. Enhance awareness and skills to generate physically intuitive visuals to accompany their data for effective communication, including methods to generate compelling, but accurate, graphical abstract of their work.",

    "overview": "Plot is easy to define and difficult to execute. We know that narratives require some form of animating force, and we know that this force hinges on a series of causally-linked events, sometimes. Not always. In this seminar we'll work through two disparate novel genres---autofiction and the campus novel---to tease out what makes for compelling story-telling energy: a political or cultural or personal crisis, a disconnect between public and private behavior, subgenres and their expectations (there's a hilarious epistolary novel in our list, but there are also striking examples of science fiction, horror, the fantastical, and the crime novel), hunger, desire, hypocrisy, satire (academic and otherwise), setting, ticking clocks and timetables, and our direct lived experience. The latter is crucial: we find our most interesting plots in life. We'll also be sure to connect these elements beyond the novel and into each of our genres: we'll discover how these same narrative engines animate poetry and creative nonfiction.\n\nOur reading list will include Sofia Samatar's The Practice, The Horizon, and the Chain, Annie Ernaux's Simple Passion, Claire Louise Bennett's Pond, W.G. Sebald's The Emigrants, Lisa Tuttle's My Death, Amy Gentry's Bad Habits, Mary McCarthy's The Groves of Academe, Vladimir Nabokov's Pnin, Julie Schumacher's Dear Committee Members, James Hynes's The Lecturer's Tale, and Lucy Ives's Loudermilk.\n\nWe'll work through a considerable deal of material together, and we'll help each other find ways to explore the possibilities of that material. But I'll also ask each of you to bring in a short published piece that you love that we'll all read; it should be a piece in your primary genre---a short story or a poem or an essay---that you feel best exploits one of the topics discussed.\n\nEvery week, we will all (1) read a novel, (2) respond, (3), read the short piece chosen by one of our classmates. In addition, one of us will be responsible for a presentation on the chosen short piece.",

The discussions will be accompanied by theoretical and historical readings that provide a framework for their analysis and fictional texts that give more context. Among other topics, discussions of the films and texts will cover subalternity and the Third World, sexual and racial politics, urban violence, postcolonial poetics, genocide, cultural hybridism, dictatorship and populism, and technologies of power.

    "overview": "If all seasoned politicians in a fragile democracy are implicated in wide-scale corruption, but if the country is facing an acute economic crisis requiring experience at the helm, what ought to be done about the corrupt, and who ought to decide? What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two moral ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy.",

    "overview": "The purpose of this course is to present an overview of the field of psychology. The topics we will cover include research methods, the biology of behavior and emotion, perception, memory, thinking and problem solving, emotion, social influences on behavior, personality, and psychological disorders. A combination of class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill knowledge of the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of a laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have firsthand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication.

Their aesthetic innovation often depicted art and love (or sex) as parallel (or contradictory) ways to create meaning the wasteland of Modernity.  In this class, we will read and discuss canonical, lesser-known, and popular texts of ‘20s in order to explore how these revolutionary writers saw love and art in their own time and, maybe, in the future.",

What distinguishes kinds like H2O and lions from kinds like ‘animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo'? Are race and gender real and in what way? Are groups like the Supreme Court more than a collection of their members? How should we understand claims about possibilities, such as ‘If kangaroos did not have tails, they would fall over'? And how do social structures (that is, social practices, social roles, institutions) cause social outcomes?  In this course, we will cover philosophical views on ontology (what exists), fundamental levels of reality, the composition of social groups, natural and social kinds, the nature of race and gender, possibility and necessity, and social structural causation. There will be particular emphasis on social aspects of reality.",

    "overview": "\"Gender, Power, Politics\"\n\nThis seminar will investigate how gender shapes politics, and how politics in turn shapes gender, with gender conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, co-constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, and official categorization to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy, classification systems, and citizenship? How have movements and counter-movements around the transformation of gender developed, and how have gendered divides influenced politics of all sorts? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include grassroots democratic activism, the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as examining formal politics and policies. We will read and discuss scholars drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological traditions, and we engage with analyses of a variety of contexts across the world (the US, other rich capitalist democracies, postcolonial states and beyond), striving to situate states and political mobilization in global contexts. Because this course is interdisciplinary, students will gain greater understanding of the diverse disciplinary approaches to gendered politics of political science, sociology, history and gender and sexuality studies.",

To that end, the course will task students with gaining an understanding of the nuances of black life via its entanglement with the afterlife of slavery and contemporary radicalism; with trans life via its troubling of the gender binary; and black trans life via the ways that blackness and transness interact and converge.",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "This course is about the relationships between climate and human society from historical perspectives. It is a discussion-oriented class on the role of climate in human experience, covering three themes: how the shifting atmospheric (weather) patterns impacted the dawn of humanity and Early Holocene cultural evolution about 10,000 years ago; the effects of the Little Ice Age on global history; and the implications of the human-induced climate change of the recent centuries for our unfolding future. We will develop skills to read, listen, and observe critically, effectively draw inferences, and summarize compelling ideas about how climate has shaped the human experience, including our notions of time, culture, and progress and how human ambitions and innovations are changing the planet. The class will explore various sources for studying climate history, from documents, visual arts, geosciences, oral literature, and artifacts to documentaries. Students will also discuss the different debates and ideas about the human-induced climate change epoch (Anthropocene), using the historical approach to understand the problems and solutions. In addition, students will be guided in setting and evaluating their academic goals and adjusting to the rhythm of college life.",

    "overview": "Skilled writers paint lively pictures with words, as do thinkers whose expert writing compels us to reimagine the world. Description is a practice of evoking the observable properties of a thing, event, text, or cultural phenomena for a reader that may not experience it firsthand. This course introduces students to the craft of thick description of cultural artefacts and happenings, and its application in a range of academic and creative pursuits at/beyond the university. Students will also learn to mobilize description as evidence in academic writing, theory making, and as a means for forging persuasive arguments about the world around them. Course activities include a combination of critical ethnography assignments; close reading of objects; events and ephemera; classroom readings; peer feedback; and, crucially, the patient art of revising. The craft of description should prepare students for a multitude of disciplines and intellectual curiosities.",

    "overview": "Yiddish, which was developed in the Middle Ages as a Judeo-German language, became the language which most Jews had spoken in East and West Europe until the Second World War. We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust. Class materials will be comprised of articles and book chapters to provide the historical, cultural, and political context of the eras we will discuss, and of essays, short stories, and poems translated from Yiddish to English. No previous knowledge of Yiddish or of Yiddish culture or history is required. All course materials will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions.\n\nThis course is taught in English",

Topics will include, but are not limited to, the contribution of these communities to digestion and gut health, mood, obesity, the immune system, fertility and pregnancy, and neurological disorders. This is a rapidly expanding field, and we will place a special emphasis on exploring these topics through review of primary research articles.",

Inherent in this reading of the lives of Latina/o/x youth is an examination of the ways in which they experience and act upon racial discourse, state policies and practices, cultural or identity shifts, and/or political innovations.

How do others frame our behaviors for their own purposes. What kind of work do people put into constructing the memories of themselves and others? Are memories political? Where do heroes come from? How about villains?\n\n\tFortunately for us, a number of cultural sociologists and social psychologists have spent their careers writing about these topics. We will spend the quarter engaging with these scholars and their texts, while bringing in current and historical examples of reputation management. Throughout the quarter, we will think through sociological concepts like trust, style, drama, jokes, character, coolness, gossip, and fame. \n\n\tBy then end of this course, we will know to think carefully and analytically about how reputations emerge, how they persist, and how they change. In doing so, we will see that our perceptions of others come from somewhere, and it is worthwhile to take a step back and understand where our perception's of others come from.\"",

    "overview": "Each year, world leaders gather to negotiate pathways to addressing climate change. As the largest gathering of heads of state, the annual Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP) shines a light on our collective futures, bringing hope and skepticism around climate change to the fore. Despite nearly three decades of negotiations, the world is unlikely to avoid devastating impacts from climate change, where average global temperature increases will exceed the 2oC goal and is nearing well over 3oC. What, then, do COPs achieve? What role do they play in addressing global climate change? What role does science, business, technology, solidarity movements, and civil society play in shaping the global politics of climate change, and there with the potential to address climate change?\n\nIn this research seminar, students will design and conduct original empirical research on the Twenty-ninth Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC, which will be held in Baku, Azerbaijan from November 11 - 24, 2024 with some virtual components accessible online. The seminar is structured to establish a baseline understanding of global climate governance. Students enrolled in this course should consider themselves research apprentices and collaborators. There are three parts to this course: literature review, research design, and execution. Students are expected to conduct original research related to their dissertations or senior theses OR can participate as a researcher in an ongoing collaborative research project that examines the politics of sites of global environmental governance like COPs.\n\nThe course is appropriate for graduate and advanced undergraduate students interested in conducting research on Climate COPs from different disciplinary backgrounds. Advanced undergraduates will take part in the digital side of the COP convening, while graduate students will have the option to travel to the COP, depending on additional course commitments during the fall quarter. Enrollment is by permission only; interested students should apply through the Roberta Buffett Institute for Global Affairs. The application will launch in early spring quarter. Please visit buffett.northwestern.edu for more information, including details on travel funding.",

    "overview": "This course acquaints students with both the power and limitations of formal deductive logic. We want true premises to lead to true conclusions---that is, we want the truth of the conclusions to follow from the truth of the premises. When this happens, we say that the premises entail the conclusions.  Logic examines this \"follows from\", or entailment, relation, and how to represent sentences in an idealized way that captures (at least some) of that relationship.   Logic makes subtle mistakes easier to spot—and this is useful in philosophy where arguments can be quite intricate!  The first step is learning how to represent sentences in natural language in a symbolic language, which allows for step-by-step reconstruction of natural language arguments.  The second step is determining whether the argument, so represented, has features that mark it as an entailment.  When it does, conclusions follow from premises!  When it doesn't---either the conclusions don't follow, or we need to refine our formal representation of the argument.      The course begins by examining truth-functional logic:  a system for treating arguments involving \"and\", \"or\", \"not\", and \"if…then\" constructions.  We'll then show how this logic is inadequate, but how its main shortcomings are met by first-order logic, which also accommodates arguments involving quantifier words like \"all\", \"none\", and \"some\".",

The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the materials currently in use in magnetic data storage and processing, together with an overview of the recording and read processes in magnetic hard disc drives, as well as development of next generation magnetic memories. Further to give the student enough theory background in magnetism and magnetic materials to understand WHY particular materials are favored. \n\nThe course is not quantum-mechanical in outlook as this is not really necessary to explain the materials choices. The main theoretical background will be used to arrive at an understanding of the basic energy terms that control the properties of magnetic materials when they are patterned at the nanoscale. Magnetic device sizes are fast becoming smaller than the limit for semiconductor devices and this places considerable challenges on the materials systems that can be used. New and current research directions in this field will also be introduced towards the end of the course.",

Our goal in this seminar is to examine and explore the relationship between theory-building and social change and what Collins describes as the \"recursive relationship\" between theory and action in recent and foundational Black feminist, trans, and queer interdisciplinary knowledge projects central to the field of Gender \u0026 Sexuality Studies. We examine the new ways of knowing (methodologies) and forms of knowledge (epistemologies) that critical theories of intersectionality, trans liberation, and queer becoming enact, the social justice movements in which these knowledge projects were forged, and the activist projects they have inspired. Throughout, we also engage in \"critical praxis\" by experimenting with practices of archiving \u0026 archival research, oral history collection, (auto)ethnography, and popular education to explore the analytical and methodological tools each offers and work towards designing a final (capstone) project that contributes to these resistant knowledge projects.",

    "overview": "In the United States, we often talk about Latinx people using blurry labels. We discuss the Latino vote, the Hispanic population, and the Latinx community. This course explores the nuances of these labels through stories narrated by Latinx authors. As we follow characters through conflicts and inhabit their quotidian lives, we will navigate between the specificity of a story and the complexity of a Latinx identity. Class discussions will study emotional ties to language, feminist thought, Latinx Indigeneities, and queer storytelling. Our readings will alternate between short stories, poetry, non-fiction writing, and one novel. As we move between forms and genres, we will pay particular attention to what Latinx authors achieve by choosing to tell their story in a poem, a short story, an essay, or a novel, as well as what each of these forms asks of us as readers. \n\nA nine-week course cannot do justice to the rich genealogy of Latinx writing. This course follows an illustrative sample of Latinx authors from the 1980s to the present. It aims to provide students with a historical, political, and literary foundation for further exploration of Latinx literature.",

    "overview": "The late 20th century's global wave of transitions from authoritarianism to democracy was heralded by many as the historic triumph of Liberal Democracy over all other forms of governance.  It marked an 'end point' to political evolution, where henceforth democracy would be the only legitimate game in town. However, a more sober perspective prevails today. A global trend of regressions from democracy to autocracy, often with mass political support, has replaced the democratizing trend. In this course we will examine meanings of \"autocracy\" and \"democracy\" and debates about how transitions from authoritarianism to democracy succeed or fail.  Then we will turn to analysis of the contemporary global trend of \"backsliding\" by established democracies toward more autocratic politics.  Country case studies will be drawn from Western Europe, the Middle East, the Western Hemisphere, and Eastern Europe.",

It aims to further develop students' Chinese proficiency through: (1) consolidating the foundation built in students' beginning modern Chinese courses; (2) introducing them to more complex grammatical structures, varieties of language styles, and cultural information. Upon satisfactory completion of the course, students are expected to be able to handle various types of more complex daily conversational situations and short passages on familiar topics. Successful completion of CHINESE 121-3 will satisfy the WCAS foreign language requirement. In addition, they will reach Intermediate mid to Intermediate high in reading, writing, listening and speaking according to ACTFL proficiency guidelines.",

Students will significantly increase their knowledge of Italy's history and culture. After the completion of the entire sequence of Italian 102, students will be eligible to study in Italy and will be ready to embark on the minor or major in Italian. The second-year Italian course sequence completes the two-year WCAS language requirement. The classroom is very lively, with lots of conversation, partnering, and small group exercises. Students will be guided toward independence, posing and solving language problems on their own and in collaboration with classmates.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

This class considers blackness and psychology from three perspectives: 1) How psychology has helped create the notion of race, 2) How psychology has treated black bodies historically, and 3) How these show up in the modern, everyday interactions we have. Through course readings, discussions, and written assignments, we will develop and apply an understanding of how psychology makes blackness, and the psychological implications of a race-aware society. We'll also learn how to read, critique, and write psychological research. Course readings will include journal articles and select chapters from popular press books. There is no required textbook.",

Students will be asked to analyze the readings closely, and to write several essays based on imitations of the style, structure, syntax, and narrative devices found in the readings.

Our bodies are important to us.They are also important to the institutions we are a part of, including our families, our schools, our jobs, and our country. They are all invested in keeping our bodies healthy and productive. However, the array of institutions interested in the value of our bodies often have additional incentives- our health is surrounded by a hoard of controversies: - Why do some people get better medical care than others? - How should the healthcare system be organized? - How do we balance the risks of new medical treatments with the benefits? -What makes the stigma associated with disease and disability so enduring? - What happens when no diagnosis can be made? This course offers conceptual tools and perspectives for answering these controversies. To do so it surveys a variety of topics related to the intersections of health, biomedicine, culture, and society. We will analyze the cultural meanings associated with health and illness; the political debates surrounding health care, medical knowledge production, and medical decision-making; and the structure of thesocial institutions that comprise the health care industry. We will examine many problems with the current state of health and healthcare in the United States and also consider potential solutions.",

Predicting and modulating those dynamics requires the development of accurate mathematical and computational models. In this class, you will learn about mathematical and computational techniques for analyzing and predicting biological dynamics. Techniques will include statistical models, discrete- and continuous- time dynamical models, and stochastic models. Applications will cover a range of scales, from biomolecules to population dynamics, with an emphasis on common mathematical concepts and computational techniques, the interpretation of existing data, and making predictions for new experiments.",

How do colonial legacy and international political economy shape African states? How is politics practiced on the continent? What explains Africa's uneven economic trajectories and diverse patterns of conflicts? How to explain the large variation within Africa in the strength of the state, the levels of economic growth and respect for democratic institutions? What role identities (ethnic, religious and class) play out in politics? What are the current dilemmas and questions in African politics? The course is organized around the following themes: the formation of the state in Africa; the practice of power, regime types and forms of government, the role of religion, identity and politics; the challenges of development and the economic dimensions of African politics; authoritarianism and democratic experiments; violence, terror, and security; Africa in world politics. While the course is not designed as a study of individual countries, in exploring the themes and trends that dominate politics across Africa, we draw on case studies from a variety of countries on the continent.",

We will study various theories; while no single model can claim to have the answer to these difficult questions, these models can inform us on some important determinants of long-run growth patterns and development performances. In this course, we will cover some of the leading theories to understand different aspects of long-run growth and development, including but not limited to: savings and capital accumulation, technological change, structural change, the demographic transition, income distribution, and imperfect credit markets.",

    "overview": "Chemistry 350-1,2,3 is a full-year, 3-quarter laboratory course intended to be taken by all students in the junior year of the chemistry major program.  As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence.  As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year.  Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors.\n\nThe full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of:\n\t\t\ninstrumental analysis\nsynthesis of inorganic compounds\nsynthesis of organic compounds\nspectroscopy\n\nThe course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\".  That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion.  This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.  For example:\n\n- A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure.  Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made.\n\n- A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest.\n\nIn these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis.  You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.  \n\nChemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The rest of this course deals with advanced techniques of synthetic organic chemistry, but you will be expected to use mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, as well as the techniques of IR and UV/visible spectroscopy that you have learned previously, to characterize the compounds that you synthesize.",

    "overview": "Since its inception, cinema has been a great factory of medieval imagination. Starting from the silent film ‘L'Inferno' (1911), a transposition of  Dante's ‘Hell', the Italian film tradition has shown an original way of ‘remaking' the  medieval past. Italian  directors have drawn from their 'national' medieval literary tradition avoiding the fantasy genre typical of Hollywood. The Italian medieval film plays with realism, spiritualism, pauperism, comedy, sexual irreverence and political commentary. This course explores films by world-famous directors such as Roberto Rossellini, Federico Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Liliana Cavani inspired by the Italian medieval literature, history and visual arts to consider, among other things, how the projection of the past served as a reflection on the difficult present of the nation.",

However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication.

(2) How do power and politics shape humans' interactions with the environment? These questions are critical to understanding and addressing the current issues of climate change, neoliberal capitalism, and environmental justice. Topics discussed in this class will include environmental scarcity and degradation, sustainability, resilience and conservation. Readings will come from a variety of disciplines within the social sciences and humanities. Case studies will range from the historical to the present-day.

Some champion it as a liberation from the provincialism of national and/or Euro-centric canons and methods. Others critique it as the cultural analog of imperialism and capitalist globalization, leveling diverse and incompatible oral and textual traditions into something recognizable as \"literature\" in a few \"major\" languages.\n\nIn this seminar we will read about a variety of ways of conceiving the \"world\" of world literature. After considering some of the most influential and canonical models in recent literary studies (Damrosch, Casanova), we will study a variety of alternative forms of literary world-building, such as Soviet internationalism, transnational Black solidarity movements of the early twentieth century, and script-worlds (such as the Sinosphere). Our readings will range from classic theoretical texts by Herder, Kant, and Marx to publications from the past two or three years (Nergis Ertürk, Madhumita Lahiri, Musab Younis), by way of such major contemporary critics and theorists as Emily Apter, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Pheng Cheah, Fredric Jameson, Lydia Liu Amir Mufti, and Roberto Schwarz.",

They are also important to the institutions we are a part of, including our families, our schools, our jobs, and our country. They are all invested in keeping our bodies healthy and productive. However, the array of institutions interested in the value of our bodies often have additional incentives- our health is surrounded by a hoard of controversies:\n\n-\tWhy do some people get better medical care than others?\n-\tHow should the healthcare system be organized?\n-\tHow do we balance the risks of new medical treatments with the benefits?\n-\tWhat makes the stigma associated with disease and disability so enduring?\n-\tWhat happens when no diagnosis can be made?\n\nThis course offers conceptual tools and perspectives for answering these controversies. To do so it surveys a variety of topics related to the intersections of health, biomedicine, culture, and society. We will analyze the cultural meanings associated with health and illness; the political debates surrounding health care, medical knowledge production, and medical decision-making; and the structure of the social institutions that comprise the health care industry. We will examine many problems with the current state of health and health care in the United States and also consider potential solutions.\n\nCross listed with HUM 220-0-20",

Seen from this perspective, dragons, witches, vampires, zombies, and werewolves serve as giant warning signs, cautioning against entering spaces that are, nonetheless, persistently alluring. (As you have no doubt noticed, signs such as \"No Swimming,\" \"No Ice Skating,\" \"No Loud Music\" tend to prohibit activities that many people find enjoyable.) In this course, we will examine different kinds of monsters and the dangers they represent in works of literature, film, and art. How do these monsters threaten, and how do they help to produce, the civilizing categories of self, family, and nation? How do they animate and help to enforce taboos relating to gender, sexuality, race, and religion? While we will read a core group of theoretical texts together, students will also have considerable latitude to research and analyze monsters of their choosing.",

    "overview": "Realists argue that the formation of a military alliance depends on states' need for expanded deterrence. However, military alliances are not necessarily terminated even when the external threat faced by allies decreases. Instead, alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the US-South Korea alliance, have expanded their roles beyond mere military cooperation. They now include cooperation on various fronts, such as the economy, culture, and even environmental matters. This course delves into the dynamic changes occurring within military alliances and how these shifts impact the formation, termination, and overall effectiveness of alliances both theoretically and empirically. Throughout this course, we will explore a variety of features characterizing alliances, including aggregated power, institutionalization, collective identity, and norms. By analyzing these factors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms at play within military alliances.",

    "overview": "Tibet is an ethnic autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. This status recognizes the distinctive cultural and political heritage of Tibet but nonetheless affirms Tibet as an integral part of China. Tibet was \"Peacefully Liberated\" by the People's Liberation Army in 1950-1951. Previously, the Republican and Qing imperial states variously claimed sovereignty or suzerainty over Tibet. Many Tibetans, whether living in Tibet or abroad, contest the historical and moral legitimacy of this rule, or question the particular arrangements that govern the place of Tibet, Tibetan people, and Tibetan language and culture as part of China's mosaic of fifty-six ethnic groups. The Dalai Lama (a Buddhist spiritual leader), and foreign supporters as diverse as Bjork and Paris Hilton, have made \"Free Tibet\" a familiar slogan and social cause. Within China such sentiments are commonly viewed as a serious attack on national integrity. This course examines competing claims regarding the national status of Tibet in light of the historically complex cultural and political relationships between Tibet and China. We will focus on the specifics of 20th c. Chinese and Tibetan nationalisms and probe the nature of nations and nationalism generally. As a famous essay we will study asks, \"What is a nation?\" We will also consider the relevance of history-based nationalist arguments concerning religious freedom, cultural autonomy, modern progress, and the nature of complex, multi-cultural nations, such as China (or, for that matter, the USA).",

While studying the language, students will be introduced to Italy and its people and they will gain both language and cultural competence.  At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs.\n\nThis course is the first in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

In the second part of the class, we will examine a variety of Kafka's so-called animal stories, guided by the premise that the \"animals\" in his stories—an ape who learns to talk, a dog who begins to question where dogdom gets its food, etc.—are related to what Nietzsche envisioned under the heading of \"the superhuman.\"   This class has been designated for Ethical and Evaluative Thinking Foundational Discipline as well as Literature and Arts Foundational Discipline.

    "overview": "The aim of this course is to introduce the histories of feminisms and feminist consciousness in the Sinosphere, and to thus provide students with exposure to non-Western-centered cases of feminist struggles for human rights and social justice from the late nineteenth century to the present. To achieve this goal, we will analyze a variety of sources, including literature, films, and other media by authors and activists concerned with the lives and realities of Chinese women.  In the course of our discussions, we will map our respective positionalities vis-à-vis the study of feminist engagements, histories, and actors in the Sinophone. \nThroughout the quarter we will combine our engagement with primary and secondary sources to navigate questions like: How do we study feminisms within the remit of Chinese studies? What biases, legacies, and challenges do we need to contend with as scholars working (mostly) in the Anglophone outside of the Sinosphere? Who determines when and where Sinophone feminist engagements emerged? What disciplinary methodologies and tools do we have in our interdisciplinary toolbox that we can deploy as researchers and as teachers? \n\nWe will be joined in this enterprise by two exciting and distinct cohorts both virtually and in person. A series of guest speakers based in the USA, Europe, mainland China, and Taiwan who, in their roles as scholars and activists, will help us probe the contested claims about the births and birthplaces of Chinese feminisms, to engage, critique, and discuss both conventional and alter/native approaches to studying and teaching Sinophone feminisms in the Anglophone. We will thus have the opportunity, to engage in a dialogue with scholars like Barbara Mittler, Wang Zheng, Jia Tan, and others. For each of these lectures, we will share a virtual synchronous classroom with fellow classmates in Heidelberg University, who will attend an intensive version of this course over Summer 2024, also taught by Professor Zamperini. Our learning will thus help us build a collective, transcultural, and global community of thinkers and researchers, one that helpfully will continue long after the end of our course at the end of the Fall quarter.\n\nKnowledge of Chinese and previous exposure to the course's topics, while helpful, is not required.",

More than ever before, organizations produce and consume vast amounts of quantitative data. Such information informs economic and political decision-making at the highest levels. Quantitative data are said to enhance the precision, accuracy, rationality, and objectivity of decisions.\n\nWe will examine how quantitative data are produced and consumed in a variety of organizational contexts, what role they play in real-world decision-making, and why such data continues to make us nervous. What circumstances make it easier or harder to derive quantitative measures? Can such data be used to produce rational decisions, or simply to rationalize decisions? We will explore these issues using examples drawn from private and public-sector decision-making, and the world of \"big data.\"",

    "overview": "The aim of this course is to interrogate the histories and logics of race and racism as concepts, beginning with the interrogation of the use of each concept in two different texts. In considering the significance of race and racism as a concepts, it critiques the discursive traditions in which they been traditionally narrated as historically self-evident objects. The course turns attention to the contested social construction of race within the concept of racism, revealing the suppression of the colonial formation of race as a political object of contestation, which in turn facilitates the privileging of race as a natural object of scientific investigation. In exposing race as constituted by a colonial and governmental lineage rather than a biological or ethnic ancestry, the course shifts the conceptual meaning of racism from its contemporary anchorage in ideology and the exception in western sovereignty, to the constitutive logics of convention and regime in contemporary western liberal democracies. Seeking to establish a reformulated concept of race and racism in the material and discursive terms of governance and histories of practices rather than ideology and histories of ideas, the course draws upon historical theoretical method of genealogy.",

    "overview": "This graduate seminar examines international solidarity struggles in the wake of the Black liberation movement. Spanning the late 1960s through the early 1990s, it focuses on US-based solidarity movements with southern Africa, including the struggles against Portuguese colonialism and apartheid South Africa.  Key questions: Why did the early 1970s see a resurgence of a Black American left strongly rooted in internationalist concerns? What was the Tricontinental and why was Cuba so involved in southern Africa? What role did the Sino-Soviet split play in African decolonization and international solidarity efforts?  Why was the Sixth Pan African Congress in Tanzania such a flashpoint for a Black Nationalist/Left schism? What was its aftermath? How did the rise of Black feminism shape US solidarity struggles? How did race and racism shape US solidarity campaigns with the Angolan and Mozambican liberation movements and the antiapartheid movement?  What were sources of leadership in the solidarity movements and what role did churches, unions, students play? How did southern African freedom struggles, and allied international solidarity campaigns, collide with a resurgent/persistent anticommunist white supremacist political leadership in the US, particularly in the Reagan era?  What was the aftermath of this collision? How did solidarity work evolve in the wake of formal political independence? How did activists build an independent (pre-internet) media/information network?",

    "overview": "Race is socially constructed—but how is it medically constructed? This seminar surveys Black, Latinx, Asian, and Indigenous American literary and cultural production to question how \"healthy\" bodies in the United States are constituted, and in turn, what these racialized processes reveal about the essential role of race in producing a body politic. Concomitantly, we will also read scholarship from ethnic studies that charts racialized comorbidities, pre-existing conditions, and environmental racism, as well as work that expands our understanding of race's imbrications with medical paradigms such as eugenics, genetics, informed consent, reproductive rights, disability, mental illness, and, of course, pandemics.\n\nIn addition to excavating the long histories and present problems surrounding medical racism, another goal of this course is tracking the medicalization of race itself. As such, we will challenge commonly held perceptions of bodies, pain, ability, and the constitution of equitable futures. We will also supplement our reading with guest lectures from medical professionals working at the intersection of race and medicine. Students will take away from the class a deeper grasp of the discourse surrounding race and medicine, as well as how to deploy this knowledge in their critical interpretations of cultural production. Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do texts by writers of color challenge normative assessments of what constitutes health and wellness? How do we ethically consider race and medicine without resorting to postracial idealism? And to what extent can creative experiments generated in art and literature re-envision the medicalized terms under which race is understood?",

    "overview": "This course is an introduction to the history of modern Southeast Asia, from the middle of the eighteenth century to the end of World War II. The region comprises eleven modern nation-states: Burma/Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, and East Timor. Its history can seem like a bewildering parade of princes, plenipotentiaries, presidents, and prime ministers: Diponegoro, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh, Thibaw, Chulalongkorn, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Johannes Van Den Bosch, Sir Hugh Clifford, and Paul Doumer, among many others. This course focuses, therefore, on the economic and social changes that have spanned the region and give its disparate parts historical unity. It begins by charting the contours of Southeast Asian social structures on the eve of European colonial rule; it then examines Southeast Asians' responses to the challenges and opportunities of their region's integration with new markets during the era of European high imperialism; and it details the social transformations that followed from depression and war, in the mid-twentieth century, including violent peasant rebellions and the birth of communism.",

    "overview": "Philosopher Lucious Outlaw understands Africana philosophy as a \"gathering notion used to cover collectively particular articulations, and traditions of particular articulations, of persons African and African-descended that are to be regarded as instances of philosophizing.\" Broadly, Africana philosophy considers work from diverse areas in Africa, the Caribbean, and North America. Central questions discussed herein include very common philosophical questions such as: \"What does it mean to be a human being?\";  \"how do we account for the past (or time, more generally)?\";  and \"how is knowledge about ourselves—as thinking subjects—possible?\" However, what makes these questions unique to Africana philosophy is their being asked in light of Western modernity, colonialism, and slavery by or about African-descended people. This is so since, as Louis Gordon tells us, \"there was no reason for the people of the African continent to have considered themselves as Africans until that identity was imposed upon them through conquest and colonization.\" So the question: \"What does it mean to be a human being?\" is raised in light of the humanity of African descended peoples that was called into question beginning with Western modernity, colonialism, and slavery. This course introduces students to philosophical work done by African and African descended people on a plethora of issues, many of which are intersecting. In so doing, it highlights the impact of racialized and racist conditions, historical and present social and political structures, and linguistic and cultural formations of African-descended groups throughout the world.",

    "overview": "Recent bestsellers such as The Girl on the Train are part of a long legacy of wildly popular murder fiction. In the early nineteenth century, murder and other forms of gothic violence were often confined to remote castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the explosion of detective stories and crime fiction, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded both the supposedly blissful domestic scene and the modern city. Writers started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about which deaths are considered \"grievable.\" Increasingly, authors depicted amateur detectives who were skeptical of the social and legal order they were reestablishing through their work. Beginning with founders of the genre Edgar Allen Poe and Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), this course follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled tales, mid-century psychological thrillers by Patricia Highsmith, and recent detective fiction by Walter Mosley. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, we will conclude with a survey of twenty-first-century chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins and others. Readings will be supplemented with films, including excellent adaptations of The Girl on the Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley.\n\nPlease note that this class is not open to students who took an earlier version of this course.",

This course will involve learning about gender as well as applying gender theory. We will study a variety of theoretical approaches to the study of gender, with particular focus on how problems are identified and theories are developed. We will examine several emergent cases of gender theorization -- childhood gender and sexuality panics, bathroom surveillance, and the intersex experience, among others. By the end of the term, students will be able to 1) describe and compare theoretical anchors for the sociological study of gender and 2) in writing, apply gender theory to original ethnographic data. This is a reading-heavy upper division course and prior course experience in gender/sexuality studies (by way of taking Gender \u0026 Society or other course work) is strongly advised.",

It is often said that in riding a horse \"we borrow freedom.\" From winged Pegasus of Greek mythology, to mystical Kelpies of Celtic lore, to the Hippogriffs in Harry Potter, horses hold a special allure for humans that transcends cultures. Come explore the power of the sacred human-horse bond as represented in art, film, and popular culture. Come learn about the use of horses in healing veterans with PTSD as we visit \"Brave Hearts,\" the country's largest healing horsemanship program right here in Illinois. Do \"horse whisperers\" truly exist? What do we make of divine horses portrayed in myth and symbol, horses as spiritual teachers, practices of horse meditation and healing, spiritual journeys with horses, ghost horses, and those who practice horsemanship as a spiritual life path? Your guide for this adventure is Dr. T., a religion, ecology, and media professor and lifelong horsewoman.",

    "overview": "This course responds to shifts in paradigms of gender and sexuality in writing from the global south. Should we use western terms (e.g., \"gay\" and \"lesbian\") to describe sexual practices in the global south? What are the main theoretical issues in postcolonial studies, and how would the positions change if we factored in gender and sexuality? How are sex relations used as an allegory of the national condition? How does sexuality intersect with other postcolonial concerns (e.g., environmental crises). What are the attitudes toward inter-species sex among postcolonial writers? How best do we integrate activist positions in postcolonial concerns?  Authors to be discussed include Jessica Hagedorn, Witi Ihimaera, H. Nigel Thomas, Nawal el Saadawi, Chris Abani, K. Sello Duiker, Suniti Namjoshi, and Lawrence Scott. We will consider postcolonial theoretical statements by a wide range of thinkers (e.g., Keguro Macharia, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Gayatri Gopinath, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Chinua Achebe etc.).",

    "overview": "COURSE TITLE: Renewing Our Democracy: Perspectives on the Path Forward\n\nOur democracy is caught in a multi-front crisis. Severe and racialized polarization divides our two major political coalitions. Some of the wealthiest and most powerful corporations and individuals fuel and benefit from our divisions, and their interplay has fueled gridlock, corruption, and dysfunction in Washington - which in turn has increased the public's appetite for more authoritarian leadership. Disinformation is rampant. Americans can't agree on basic truths like whether Joe Biden was legitimately elected in 2020 - even as attacks on nonpartisan election administration and the right to vote are accelerating in the run-up to the 2024 election. Americans today have historically low levels of trust in one another, in our government, and in our democratic system. \n\nAddressing these challenges, renewing our democracy, and building a healthier political culture will require a range of efforts. Social movements and grassroots activists have an essential role to play - in concert with high-integrity politicians and public officials, journalists, technologists, business and philanthropic leaders, and others. \n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar will engage nationally-prominent guest speakers as we survey a broad landscape of efforts to renew US democracy, with particular emphasis on the role of grassroots movements. Students will analyze issues such as polarization, disinformation, voting rights, authoritarian movements, and the roles of media and technology.",

    "overview": "The course begins with a foundational competency in main concepts from the French philosopher Michel Foucault, including discipline and biopower, the productivity and plurality of power; normalization and its dependence on \"abnormality;\" the conditions under which freedom is also a form of subjection; disciplinary and punitive societies, the historical a priori. We review many of the aspects of Foucault's work that have strongly impacted inquiry in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Turning, in the course's second section, to the work of French Martinian philosopher and decolonial theorist Frantz Fanon, we will critically compare Foucault's and Fanon's approaches to power, psychiatric medicine, families, biopolitics, self-surveillance, knowledge, selfhood, alterity, and colonization. Challenging both thinkers we will ask how these approaches both reinforce each other and, at times, call each other into question. Students will have the opportunity to write on each of the two French philosophers jointly or separately.\n\nThe course is reading intensive. It will include weekly contributions to class debate including online postings. your critical responses to the readings, and to each other are encouraged. The course is open to both undergraduates and graduates and includes a lecture component and separate discussion sections at the undergraduate and graduate level.",

Beyond the common aspects of coding, we touch upon visualization, data fitting, solving equations,  and tidbits of astro-, bio-, and geo-physics as well as parallel programming. The course is predominantly taken through self-paced, extensive, graded tutorials, called quizorials, inside and outside of the classroom.  Students complete a final coding project that is relevant to their research or interests, individually or in pairs.\n\nContinuing exercises will build familiarity and core strengths while final projects illustrate the computational research process from raw data or theory to somewhat polished \"research product\" and inspire development, critical thinking, creativity, persistence, and innovation.\n\nThis course bears graduate credit.\n\nNo prior programming experience is needed.\n\nOffice hours will be offered both online and in person.",

Generalized linear models are a very broad family of statistical models, loosely described as follows. The response variable has a distribution in an exponential dispersion family and the mean response is related to covariates through a link function and a linear predictor. Generalized linear models allow a unified theory for many of the models used in statistical practice, including normal theory regression and ANOVA models, loglinear models, logit and probit models for binary data and models for gamma responses and survival data.",

    "overview": "Across all industries, employers consistently rank written and oral communication in the top five skills that a new employee needs. However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

This course is an ambitious attempt at interdisciplinarity, or more aptly what Tracy Hucks and Dianne Stewart refer to as transdisciplinarity--inquiry driven research that transcends disciplinary silos. This course centers religion as the primary lens to excavate and recover representations of Afro-Caribbean religions and their North American cognates using archival sources, fiction, film, and art. Religion will serve as the framework to interrogate what counts as data, the sources in which we can locate this data, its deployment and (re)presentation. Our aim is to gain a landscape view of Caribbean\nreligious history through key moments and themes from the period of enslavement and what Rinaldo Walcott refers to as the long emancipation. The course will provide students the opportunity to explore current digital projects and learn digital tools to generate their own inquiries.",

The course has three main components. First, we look at the history of the discipline, its theoretical underpinnings, and its practical applications.  Next, we learn about archaeological methods, including how archaeologists create research designs, discover and excavate sites, and analyze artifacts and features. Last, we explore how archaeology confronts and deals with contemporary issues critical to the archaeological project and the communities that archaeologists engage with: e.g. heritage preservation and Indigenous/community rights, Black lives and Black histories, feminist archaeology and gender equality. Throughout the course, students will learn about archaeological case studies from around the globe and from a variety of historical periods.",

    "overview": "The field of linguistics is characterized by a multiplicity of approaches, assumptions, and methodologies, which leaves researchers in different fields often unable to communicate with or understand those outside their research community. But this wasn't always the case: in the mid-20th century, the study of language briefly looked as though it might be unified under the banner of Generative Grammar, which identified syntax as the core explanandum of natural language. This course traces the lineage of formal approaches to natural language syntax, with the goal of developing a bird's eye view of the field of syntax as a whole and its relationship to the broader field of linguistics. Topics of focus include: formal language theory; pre-Chomskyan and early generative syntax; disputes regarding the division of labor between syntax and semantics (\"the linguistics wars\"); and the multiplicity of contemporary approaches to syntax, including \"syntax-only\" and \"interface\" grammars, generative and non-generative approaches, and \"lexicalized\" vs \"rule-based\" grammars. Throughout, we focus on understanding the space of possible analyses and choice points in developing a linguistic analysis, as well as the special role of syntax in the history of linguistic theory.",

In this course, we will examine the individual and collective ways in which Indigenous people have resisted colonial domination in the U.S. and Canada since 1887. In addition to focusing on North America, we will also turn our attention to Hawai‘i. This course will emphasize environmental justice, and highlights religious movements, inter-tribal organizations, key intellectual figures, student movements, armed standoffs, non-violent protest, and a variety of visions for Indigenous community self-determination.",

    "overview": "The course begins with a foundational competency in main concepts from the French philosopher Michel Foucault, including discipline and biopower, the productivity and plurality of power; normalization and its dependence on \"abnormality;\" the conditions under which freedom is also a form of subjection; disciplinary and punitive societies, the historical a priori. We review many of the aspects of Foucault's work  that have strongly impacted inquiry in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Turning, in the course's second section,  to the  work of French Martinian philosopher and decolonial theorist Frantz Fanon, we will critically compare Foucault's and Fanon's approaches to power, psychiatric medicine, families, biopolitics, self-surveillance, knowledge, selfhood, alterity, and colonization. Challenging both thinkers we will ask how these approaches both reinforce each other and, at times,  call each other into question. Students will have the opportunity to write on each of the two French philosophers jointly or separately.\n\n\nThe course is reading intensive. It will include weekly contributions to class debate including online postings.  your critical responses to the readings,  and to  each other are encouraged. The course is open to both undergraduates and graduates and includes a lecture component and separate discussion sections at the undergraduate and graduate level.\n\n***Graduate students meet for a supplementary, dedicated section with the professor.***",

More human beings are being forced from their homes than ever before in history; more and more are being turned away as they seek resettlement. Global economic migration is poorly regulated and rife with exploitation. The flow of human organs for transplantation increasingly moves from the poor in the Global South to the rich in the Global North. Even the production of human babies through international surrogacy is driven by economic inequities. This course examines the role of advocacy, law, politics and ethics to preserve dignity and health as human beings and human parts increasingly circulate across global boundaries.",

The course is organized around several key terms central to social movements in the United States across this historical period including: \"free love\", \"sexual freedom\", \"sexual liberation\", \"revolutionary love\", and \"safe(r) sex.\" Our goal in this course is to explore each term in its historical moment, including the social movements that rallied around these formulations, and the theories of sex/gender/sexuality being forged, recuperated \u0026/or revised as part of this process. This course is also intended to introduce students to the practice of archival research and assignments will focus on collective research projects using pre-selected materials \u0026 curated collections. Students have the option of submitting a final research proposal that builds on course themes or completing a final research paper.",

Topics will include debates about democracy and economic development, tensions between political order and democracy, nationalism and democracy, populist and liberal variants of democracy, and historical affinities between authoritarian and democratic practice in new and established democratic regimes. Recurring themes in the course will be the relative importance of leadership, institutions, and the international order for the emergence, quality, and strength of democratic regimes. Regionally the course will be global in scope, comparing historical and contemporary experiences across historical periods and world regions (including the United States).",

    "overview": "The field of human genetics is a dynamic and innovative field that has been leveraged to develop amazing technologies and therapeutics. To better grasp the potential of genetics applications, we will cover the fundamental principles of human genetics, including but not limited to Mendelian and non-Mendelian inheritance, the chromosomal basis of inheritance, and genetic variation in human populations. We will use these topics to better understand how the genetic code influences our lives and the world around us, such as the innovations following the human genome project. We will also explore what happens when our DNA is altered leading to diseases, variation, and even therapeutics when DNA is altered intentionally. To cap the course, we will discuss how these innovations both benefit society and their possible ethical implications.  \n\nThis course is intended to provide fundamental genetics knowledge for future courses and to inform our interpretations of genetics in our everyday lives. Students will be expected to attend lectures and participate in in-class discussions, activities, and canvas discussion boards. There will be three exams and a final paper. No pre-requisite knowledge is required to take this course.",

What are the many promises—and what are the many pitfalls—of interracial encounters, and what do they reveal about the country writ large? How do minority writers understand and narrate each other? This class brings contemporary African American, Native American, Latinx, and Asian American literature into relation with a focus on interracial dynamics. By examining complex topics from Black/Asian conflict during the 1992 LA Riots to the shared border migrations of indigenous and Latinx subjects, we will develop an analytical framework attuned to how American racial identity has been differentially and unevenly constructed through history, culture, and politics. A central goal of the course is decentering whiteness as the primary locus of literary analysis, to allow for more nuanced interpretations of topics such as U.S. imperialism, mixed race identity, activism, labor history, and immigration. In the process, we will familiarize ourselves with the richness and diversity of multiethnic American literature by considering a variety of genres, including poetry, novels, short stories, and film.",

    "overview": "The U.S.-Mexico border was first envisioned in writing when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) imagined the course that a new dividing line would run: from the Gulf of Mexico through the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande until the town called \"Paso,\" west toward the Gila River and onto the Pacific Ocean. This line would mark not only land and water but also racial and ethnic formations. Indigenous nations saw their territories split in half by a border that considered their homelands wilderness. Mexicans who found themselves north of the imagined line had to grapple with a new vocabulary to define themselves as they lost their lands to settlers. Those who ended up south of the border attempted to reconcile their recent independence from Spain with the loss of half of the country as they, too, tried to piece together a narrative for their new identity. This course will walk students through the text and maps of the 1848 treaty and the literary works that continue to process its aftershocks throughout the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Some of the authors we will read include Chicana theorist Gloria Anzaldúa, Laguna Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko, and Mexican writer Yuri Herrera. We will learn about the discourse of Manifest Destiny, the Chicano Movement, and contemporary literature from Latinx, Indigenous and Mexican writers who continue to tell the stories about their ancestral lands, their migration journeys, and their encounters with a line that became both border and borderlands.",

    "overview": "This course introduces students to pressing disease and health care problems worldwide and examines efforts currently underway to address them. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, practices and forms of knowledge production characteristic of what we call \"global health\" today, and explores the environmental, social, political and economic factors that shape patterns and experiences of illness and healthcare across societies. We will scrutinize the value systems that underpin specific paradigms in the policy and science of global health and place present-day developments in historical perspective. Key topics will include: policies and approaches to global health governance and interventions, global economies and their impacts on public health, medical humanitarianism, global mental health, maternal and child health, pandemics (HIV/AIDS, Ebola, H1N1, Swine Flu), malaria, food insecurity, health and human rights, and global health ethics.",

    "overview": "Hebrew 211 is given in the Fall quarter and is meant for students who either completed Hebrew 121-3 or students who wish to expand their Hebrew knowledge and strengthen their grammar foundations. The purpose of this course is to serve as a bridge between Hebrew second year and the advanced classes of Hebrew about literature and culture (Hebrew 216) or about Israeli media (Hebrew 245). In this class students will review previous forms (such as past tense) and will learn the future tense forms, the imperative and the conditional forms, advanced connectors (such as  ללגב ,...ש ינפמ ,ןכל ), impersonal phrases with infinitive forms, more prepositions, and the condensed form of possessive. This class revolves around themes of leisure and volunteering, and each theme lends itself to certain grammatical forms, so the grammar is intertwined in the contents of these themes. Some of the themes we will engage with are food, music, trips, Israeli non-profit organizations, and more.      \n \nHebrew 211 is a quarter-long class, planned to take place during the Fall out of the assumption that students who finished the second year in the previous spring will be able to expand their Hebrew knowledge and skills so they will be better equipped to take more advanced classes in the 200 level (Hebrew 216, 245) that are given in the following winter and spring quarters. For students who placed out of Hebrew due to their previous experience with Hebrew, this class can be helpful in reviewing forms and vocabulary they learned long ago, and in practicing active usage of the language (through class discussions, presentations, etc.) so they will be able to transition smoothly to the more advanced Hebrew classes.",

By analyzing readings that include the rantings of an unemployed (and slightly unhinged) samurai and a series of \"archival\" documents, students will gain an understanding of this pivotal era in Japanese history.",

This course explores the diversity of the contemporary political experiences of Muslims in multiple and shifting contexts to address questions such as: what is the role of ideology and faith in Muslim politics? Where does political Islam come from? How does politics play out in the lives of Muslims? How diverse are contemporary political experiences of Muslims? How did immigration, globalization, Islamic revival and violent extremism and securitization policies reshape the political and religious landscape of Muslim-majority nations as well as in non-Muslim countries? What does the study of political Islam teach us about the relationship between religious and politics in the modern world?\n\nThe course is divided in three parts. In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact. In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins. In Part 3, we examine the social, political and historical dynamics shaping the politics of Muslim minorities in Europe and the USA, including the war on terror, identity politics, racialization and islamophobia.\n\nOur cross-cutting themes include state in the Muslim world, party politics, secularism, democracy, social movements, political violence, the politics of religion, security policies, globalization, citizenship, social and economic development. \n\nClass descriptions from the past two years can be viewed on the class descriptions page. https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/\nClass descriptions prior to that can be viewed in CAESAR in the Class Search and Catalogs sections.",

In this course, students will continue developing the four skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and learn various aspects of Japanese culture and society through readings, videos, written assignments, and in-class activities.\nThe emphasis will be on developing the skills necessary to describe not only their own experiences and daily lives, but also their community, general trend, and what is happening in society, while increasing vocabulary and sentence structures that they can use more precisely. Students will also practice summarizing a story that they heard, read, or watched. Careful and thorough review and preparation for each class session are expected. With consistent oral and written feedback from the instructor, students will enhance their language and cultural awareness, leading to increased understanding, appreciation, and utilization of the target language, to become autonomous learners.",

That tends to be our contemporary image, reinforced by Hollywood movies, video games, and manga. But the samurai have appeared in all kinds of guises, from the gentle, teary-eyed flute-player to the bored, bloated bureaucrat to the savage, xenophobic zealot. This course is about how the history of the samurai has been written and represented in Japan and the United States. We will start with the first attempts to record the history of Japanese warfare and end with movies, prestige tv, and manga. This is a class about samurai, but in the broadest sense, our academic objective is to explain how and why the representation of history has changed over time and space.",

While many data science problems will require knowledge of multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R and RStudio to conduct data science. Students will develop skills to effectively manage, manipulate, and analyze data in R. These skills will be developed through project/lab based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). The skills developed in this course are necessary for STAT 301-2 and STAT 301-3. ATTENDANCE AT THE FIRST CLASS IS MANDATORY",

Some of the questions are: What is democracy? Is it a form of government, a value, an ideal, a political system, a form of life, a bit of all this? Is democracy always the best political solution (in wartime? general starvation?)? Why should the whole of the people decide and not the specialists in the respective questions? Are all democratically taken decisions automatically legitimate (what about minorities\\' rights?)? How should all citizens in a democracy participate in politics? By direct self-government of the people or by voting representatives? Is everything democratically decidable or does the individual have unalterable rights? Is tolerance and/or free speech necessary for democracy and how far can it go?",

In each class, all four skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) will be practiced, always with the goal of enhancing students' communicative competence and advancing proficiency. Various methods and forms of engagement are targeted toward meeting the needs of different learning styles in a given classroom. Classroom activities will include individual, partner, and group work and will be complemented by homework exercises. An oral interview will be given in lieu of a final exam.",

    "overview": "Second-year Arabic will build on skills acquired in first-year Arabic. The course follows the integrated approach which blends the standard Arabic, Fuṣḥā, and the dialect or colloquial language, āmmiyya, in a way that reflects the authentic practice of native Arabic speakers. To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fuṣḥā will be used in reading and writing; an educated spoken version of the āmmiyya of the Levantine dialect will be used to develop speaking and listening skills we will be using.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world. \n\nArabic 121-1, taught in the Fall quarter, is the first quarter of second-year Arabic and will build on material covered and practiced during first-year Arabic (the 111 sequence).",

The history includes the practice of banishment in ancient Greece and Rome; the destruction by European conquistadors and explorers of long-settled communities in the Americas; the forced transport of \"masterless men\" from England to the colonies; the banishment of Americans of so-called African, Mexican, and Asian descent from their homes and communities; European resettlement policies for national minorities following World War One; the \"destruction of the European Jews\"; and 20th and 21st century deportations in Europe and the United States and their effects elsewhere. The course will devote attention to theories of the family and intergenerational identities that animate attachments to race and nationality, as well as comparisons among deportation policies in different regions and epochs. Students will be required to listen to actual immigration hearings and write their analyses of two of these.\n\nStudents must be able to observe at least three hours of immigration court hearings in downtown Chicago. The hearings are typically M-Th and start at 9 a.m. Professor will make information on observations available, but it is the responsibility of the student to go to court and complete the required observations.",

    "overview": "\"Neanderthal man listened to stories, if one may judge by the shape of his skull. The primitive audience was an audience of shock-heads, gaping round the campfire, fatigued with contending against the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros, and only kept awake by suspense.  What would happen next?  The novelist droned on, and as soon as the audience guessed what happened next, they either fell asleep or killed him.\" \n\n—E.M. Forster, Aspects of the Novel\n\nWhere does writing come from? By looking at examples of literature that were initially meant to be spoken aloud, we will explore how they were placed, elegantly and not, onto the page.  How does this happen?  The bardic boom, the pulpit pitch, the mad futurist with a megaphone—so many of the great works of literature were first delivered orally, then spelled out and called literature.  Speeches, psalms, slams, rants, anecdotes, manifestos, declarations, sermons, lectures, yarns, ballads, brags, jeremiads, prayers, incendiary instructions for the coming revolution—we'll investigate as many as we can of these in the readings, considering, as writers, how we can get performative narratives of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction from the stage to the page.  We will discuss, too, the instructive aspect of art and literature, the difference between voice and style, and how oral culture differs from written culture, with a serious take on Walter Ong's Orality and Literacy.  We will consider formal prosody, rhetoric, and poetic forms, and original and amusing methods inventive writers come up with to interpret the sound of speech.   Readings may include sermons by John Donne, Toni Morrison, and Herman Melville; prayers and suras from Adam Zagejewski and the Koran, Brags from Beowulf, Beastie Boys, Sharon Olds, and Shmuel HaNagid, anecdotes from Ivan Turgenev, Tatyana Tolstaya, and Olga Tokarczuk, murder ballads from Cole Porter and Dolly Parton, speeches and declarations from Susan B Anthony and Frederick Douglass, and jeremiads by Jamaica Kincaid, Valerie Solanis, and Joy Williams.\n\nWhile writing your own fictions (not necessarily from the oral tradition), we will discuss the instructive aspect of art and literature, the difference between style and voice, how delivery by great orators can change the meaning of the material, and how the speech on the page has its own specific power that makes it, in its way, a second, separate work of literature.",

That movement is part of a long history of Native activism. In this course, we will examine the individual and collective ways in which Indigenous people have resisted colonial domination in the U.S. and Canada since 1887. In addition to focusing on North America, we will also turn our attention to Hawai‘i. This course will emphasize environmental justice, and highlights religious movements, inter-tribal organizations, key intellectual figures, student movements, armed standoffs, non-violent protest, and a variety of visions for Indigenous community self-determination.",

There will be four main modules:1) The nature of Philosophy, 2) Knowledge \u0026 Reality, 3) Free Will and Determinism, and 4) Moral Philosophy. In this course, we will focus on four central philosophical questions:\n\n1) What is the nature of philosophy?\n2) What do I know?\n3) Do we have free will, or is the future already determined?  \n4) What makes actions right and wrong?\n\nThe answers to these fundamental questions matter for answering practical problems we face in our lives as individuals and as members of society: Is abortion permissible? Can we wrong somebody merely by what we say? What do we owe to people who live in poverty? What exactly are the dangers posed by AI? Is genetic engineering morally permissible? Should prison be abolished?",

Examining a variety of 20th and 21st century works—including science fiction, spoken word poetry, narrative fiction, and film—we will analyze how literature shapes and responds to planetary crisis. Which imaginative currents—apocalyptic, technocratic, communalist, militaristic—are molding readers' visions of the climatic future? Is it possible to narrate climate change as a multi-century catastrophe rooted in colonialism and the acquisition of capital? What can we learn about climate change from literature that we can't grasp through other fields of study? Since the works in this class cover a broad geographic range and include both award-winning texts and relatively unknown books, we will also theorize how—and why—particular writers' voices become central or peripheral within climate discourse.",

We review many of the aspects of Foucault's work  that have strongly impacted inquiry in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Turning, in the course's second section,  to the  work of French Martinian philosopher and decolonial theorist Frantz Fanon, we will critically compare Foucault's and Fanon's approaches to power, psychiatric medicine, families, biopolitics, self-surveillance, knowledge, selfhood, alterity, and colonization. Challenging both thinkers we will ask how these approaches both reinforce each other and, at times,  call each other into question. Students will have the opportunity to write on each of the two French philosophers jointly or separately.\n\n\nThe course is reading intensive. It will include weekly contributions to class debate including online postings.  your critical responses to the readings,  and to  each other are encouraged. The course is open to both undergraduates and graduates and includes a lecture component and separate discussion sections at the undergraduate and graduate level.\n\n***Graduate students meet for a supplementary, dedicated section with the professor.***",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "The historical juncture at which we presently find ourselves—wracked by the compounding catastrophes of the global pandemic, ecological disaster, and postcolonial neoliberalism—demands a radical rethinking of art history as an academic discipline. The urgency of redressing art history's lingering complicities with white supremacy, coloniality, and the profit motive propels us to reconsider foundational questions: What is art? What is history? What is an object? What is scholarship? What is a material? What is an archive? \n\nThis seminar addresses these and other questions from perspectives both within and beyond art history, including Black Studies, Indigenous Studies, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial theory, new materialisms, among others. Rather than assimilating subaltern voices into a hegemonic \"global art history,\" the seminar begins with the premise that art history needs rebuilding from the ground up. The goal is to work proactively and collectively towards new horizons of art historical scholarship by attending to a diverse body of methodologies that offer dynamic ways of reconceptualizing art historical narration, (inter)disciplinarity, canonization, and research.",

In this course, students will be introduced to the work of Marcus Tullius Cicero, who, in the late Republic, emerged as Rome's most skilled public speaker. Students will read one of Cicero's most famous speeches, Pro Caelio, in which Cicero defends the aristocratic Marcus Caelius Rufus, notably by attacking the (allegedly) debauched lifestyle and reliability of Caelius' former lover Clodia. Time in class will be spent reading the Latin text and reviewing essential points of grammar and syntax, as well as discussions that will deepen students' appreciation of Roman oratory, Cicero's style, and the political and social context of the late Roman Republic.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs.\n\nThis course is the first in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

    "overview": "The emergence of Muslim politics is arguably one of the defining transformations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This course explores the diversity of the contemporary political experiences of Muslims in multiple and shifting contexts to address questions such as: what is the role of ideology and faith in Muslim politics? Where does political Islam come from? How does politics play out in the lives of Muslims? How diverse are contemporary political experiences of Muslims? How did immigration, globalization, Islamic revival and violent extremism and securitization policies reshape the political and religious landscape of Muslim-majority nations as well as in non-Muslim countries? What does the study of political Islam teach us about the relationship between religious and politics in the modern world?\n\nThe course is divided in three parts. In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact. In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins. In Part 3, we examine the social, political and historical dynamics shaping the politics of Muslim minorities in Europe and the USA, including the war on terror, identity politics, racialization and islamophobia.\n\nOur cross-cutting themes include state in the Muslim world, party politics, secularism, democracy, social movements, political violence, the politics of religion, security policies, globalization, citizenship, social and economic development. \n\nClass descriptions from the past two years can be viewed on the class descriptions page. https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/\nClass descriptions prior to that can be viewed in CAESAR in the Class Search and Catalogs sections.",

The course examines the emergence of new leisure forms, sites, and practices and probes how local, regional, and global events shaped the cultural life of both Jewish and Arab societies and their intercultural relations. Throughout the course, we will discuss cafés, cinemas, beaches, nightlife, theatre, and sports venues as spaces of both intercommunal encounters and friction. We will examine how broad historical processes such as modernization, urbanization, the emergence of national identities, and the evolving national conflict between the Arab and Jewish communities shaped local leisure patterns. Also, we will analyze the interrelationship between leisure and other social constructs such as work, family, community, and nation. How did categories of ethnicity, gender, and class organize and reshape institutions and practices of leisure culture and vice versa? The course combines a wide range of primary sources as well as cultural products of Jewish and Arab writers, moviemakers, and artists. Through course readings, lectures, discussions, and collaborative assignments, students will confront the many ways in which leisure had a foundational impact on ordinary people's daily lives and the formation of collective identities in 20th-century Palestine \\ Israel.",

Instead, it will focus on the careful scrutiny of a few primary sources by prominent individuals who have contributed to the development of the discipline, but who will also be taken as \"representative\" of various historical trends. The first part of the course will rapidly outline the prehistory of the discipline and focus more extensively on the notion of evolution central to 19th century social theory. The second part of the course will deal with the individual contributions of three \"founding fathers\": Marx, Durkheim and Weber. The final part of the course will cover a few of the numerous trends of 20th century cultural anthropology.",

The course will focus on one major feature-length film per week proceeding chronologically. We will analyze films textually; and we will also focus on acquiring critical vocabularies for discussing horror cinema. Major themes and questions will include not only the question of why it's fun (or not) to be scared but also what social and philosophical themes the genre of horror opens up in surprising and provocative ways (from gender, violence, and technology to childhood, evil, and race). To catalyze discussion we will read a variety of secondary sources by authors from a range of disciplines.",

    "overview": "How can we think about the transhistorical nature of queerness in English culture? Moving from the Renaissance to the present, the course follows the literary careers of two influential tragedies --  Christopher Marlowe's Edward II and Shakespeare's adaptation and rewriting of it in Richard II -- to think about the representation of queer kingship over time. Together we'll analyze theatrical revolutionary Bertolt Brecht's landmark early twentieth-century adaptation of Marlowe's play and its \"alienation effect,\" twentieth-century productions and films of Marlowe tied to the early gay-liberation movement (Ian McKellen) and the early AIDS crisis (Derek Jarman's), and twenty-first century rewritings, including a companion play that incorporates figures in/against queer culture from Gertrude Stein, Harvey Milk, and Julie Andrews to Margaret Thatcher (Tom Stuart's play After Edward). We'll conclude with the recent gay rom-com \"Red, White, and Royal Blue.\" Critical readings will delve into the history of sexuality, queer readership and book history, and theories of dramatic adaptation and performance.",

After critically examining the concept of ‘mysticism' within Religious Studies, we will examine the historical origins of Sufism, its emergence from and relationship to foundational discourses within Islam, its engagement with the Qur'an, and the figure of the Prophet Muhammad in Sufi devotions. We will then investigate notions of ‘sainthood' in Islam, the roles of Sufism in popular Muslim piety, the centrality of the body and bodily disciplines in Sufi practice, and the writings produced by Sufis, their supporters, and critics. Particular attention will be paid to the study of Sufi literature both in prose and poetry. The course will offer a broad introduction to the historical and geographic range of Sufism in Islam, but will give special attention to Sufi traditions in the Indian subcontinent and the broader Persianate world.",

    "overview": "This is the first quarter of a two-quarter sequence on late imperial and modern China. (The second quarter covers twentieth-century China. Each course stands on its own; you will not be required to take both.) The themes linking both quarters are tensions regarding ethnic and national identity, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, and the effects of imperialist depredation. \n\nModern China was forged by the Qing (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty. Its achievements and travails continue to inform our present moment. Whether its massive territory, multi-ethnic society, complex economic and political relations with the \"West\" and the rest of Asia—and much more—key facets of contemporary China are rooted in the Qing. Formidable in warfare, the Qing created a multi-ethnic empire bound by Confucian culture, surging domestic and international commerce, and a potent imperial political structure and ideology. At the same time, millenarian and ethnic yearnings, foreign imperialism, and intellectual and political ferment threatened throughout the course of the dynasty to tear the empire apart. Topics to be explored include the Manchu conquest, the imperial state and its problematic relationship with the gentry elite, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, millenarian movements, commercial and industrial growth, intra-Asian connections, the lives of common people, foreign imperialism, US-China relations, early Chinese nationalism and feminism, human and state rights, and revolutionary radicalism.\n\nBoth classes explore the definition and development of modernity in China. As part of this process, we will question the applicability of the term \"modern\" to Chinese history and consider how the Chinese experience with imperialism has fundamentally shaped their contemporary understanding of their own history.",

    "overview": "Indigeneity and Textuality in Latin America\n\nThis course explores the notion of indigeneity and its attendant textual manifestations and representations in literary and cultural production in Latin America. First, we will consider some definitions of the term, ranging from the implicit in colonial-era texts, to the explicit in 19th and 20th century narratival and essayistic production. Secondly, we will dive into the large, diverse scholarship—much of it contemporary and ranging in origin from social sciences such as anthropology and archaeology to humanities such as history and literary studies—that has attempted to articulate indigeneity in connection to the demands of, alternately, nationalisms, vindicatory movements, social revolution, identitarian politics, and other political and cultural formations in the continent. Key amongst our considerations will be understanding not simply the shapes that indigeneity takes within these disciplinary, cultural and political contexts, but also the mechanisms that allow it to move and transform between them. We will pay special attention to the place of writing and will seek to account for the generation of indigeneity from lettered and cultural objects and their historical moments. Readings will be selected from a range of primary and secondary texts and may include Guaman Poma de Ayala, El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Popol Vuh, el Manuscrito de Huarochirí, Manuel Gamio, José Carlos Mariátegui, Fausto Reinaga, Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, José María Arguedas, Gamaliel Churata, Alison Spedding, Blanca Wiethüchter, César Calvo, Rigoberta Menchú, Marisol de la Cadena, Gonzalo Lamana, Mary Louise Pratt, Joanne Rappaport, Tom Cummins, Bruce Mannheim, Martin Lienhard, el Taller de Historia Oral Andina, and others.

Reality television shows may seem like silly \"guilty pleasures,\" but they are also illuminating cultural artifacts that reflect contemporary American behaviors, norms, and tastes. In this course—by reading sociological literature, paired with episodes of reality shows—we will learn to analyze these forms of entertainment through a social scientific lens. We will consider the following questions: What messages about race, class and gender do these shows promote? What kinds of citizens are viewers encouraged to become through this genre? How are social differences represented within these programs? What impact do these shows have on our society, if any?",

By reading the historical writings of physicians, religious scholars, officials, activists, and others, some of whom were sick \u0026 disabled, we will investigate the social construction of categories relevant to disability and (chronic) illness in the history of Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. \n\nThis course strives to respect contemporary disability justice principles, and as such, to be accessible to a range of bodyminds. Course materials will center academic and popular writings, podcasts, and memoirs, but will also include some film and visual art. Your final project will be a proposal for an archival and/or oral historical project on the history of illness and disability, which we will work towards throughout the semester. We will not carry out that proposal in this class, but you may in the future.",

    "overview": "AY25: The Hindi film industry, often called Bollywood, is famously one of the world's biggest and most recognizable. Every year, the studios in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) put out hundreds of movies, in addition to hundreds more that are released by India's other film industries in languages like Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali. Most of these movies are full of songs and dances, and bring action, comedy, tragedy, and romance together into one (often very complex) story. As the subject of our class has said, Hindi cinema \"offers poetic justice in three hours. You walk away with a smile on your lips and dried tears on your cheeks.\"\n\nFilm industries everywhere choose a few actors to elevate above all others. The biggest of these movie stars in India, and perhaps in the world, is Amitabh Bachchan. With his brooding, rebellious charisma, not to mention his ready wit, resonant baritone voice, and enviable dance moves, his \"angry young man\" persona dominated the films of the 1970s. Today, half a century after his film debut, he is still a major star. His face and voice are instantly recognizable, not only throughout South Asia and its diaspora, but in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. As his characters have aged from youthful rebels to somewhat less youthful rebels to stern patriarchs to goofy old men obsessed with their digestive tracts, he has at times seemed inescapable off the movie screen as well. He has spent time in politics, hosted a wildly successful game show, and starred in children's comic books; one fan has even built a temple to worship him as a literal idol.\nIn this course, we will focus on Amitabh Bachchan, not only because he and his films are so interesting, but because he has so much to tell us about how Indian films work and what a star is. Students will have opportunities to think and write, not only about Amitabh and his films, but about film and celebrity more broadly.",

    "overview": "Mapping the Discipline:\nA Graduate-Level Introduction to the Field of History\n\nThe purpose of this course is to offer history students a guide to \"professional literacy\" by introducing them to some of the main approaches and themes of the academic study of history.  Historians have a broad variety of strategies of investigation, interpretation, and explanation to choose from.  Understanding those strategies requires articulating methods and theoretical perspectives and recognizing the implications when others do so.  The course will orient students in some of the big debates in humanities and social-science scholarship—and their implications--with a specific focus on the contributions that historians are best equipped to make.  This will involve learning to read for deep comprehension and paying attention to the methodologies employed in the surveyed works.  Topics to be considered in the course include: defining fields of history; such as spatiality, empire, and borderlands, the use of certain analytical categories such as social class, race, gender, and other forms of identity, and the implications and impact of organizing principles such as agency and networks.  And, I should also say that, because we only have ten weeks, the course in no way claims to cover all major approaches to History.",

    "overview": "This course provides an overview of some of the major trends in Latin American literatures since 1888, while at the same time offering opportunities to improve students' oral and written Spanish.  The course will emphasize various literary styles and ideological constructions that, in different ways, reflect the complexity of Latin American writing.  While introducing students to the social and historical context in which the works were written, the course will focus on the following issues: the cultural and political dimensions of literature; the representation of class, gender, and race; the formative impact of nationalism and internationalism; and the concern for finding autochthonous modes of expression. \n\nThis course also satisfies the Global Overlay requirement. During the quarter, students will discuss assigned primary texts as well as, crucially, the broad historical, political and social processes that shaped literary and cultural production at the end of the 19th and the 20th centuries in Latin America.  The nature and complexity of these processes will be presented and engaged through lecture and discussion of scholarship on these topics. We will pay particular attention to the cultural and historical bases of literary traditions as constituted by the encounters, conflicts, tensions, and transformations of the period. Our goal is to generate the knowledge and develop the skills necessary to grapple with key issues including colonialism, empire, indigeneity, cultural imposition, transformation, memory, translation, the legacies of extractivism, ethnicity, race, and immigration. \n\nPrerequisite (may be taken concurrently): SPANISH 200-0 or 204-0",

    "overview": "\"Small-N and Case Study Methods\"\n\nThis seminar offers a broad and advanced introduction to the field of comparative and case study methodology.  The emphasis is on what are conventionally regarded in political science as \"qualitative\" methods for the analysis of a relatively small number of cases.  In sociology, this field is generally known as comparative-historical methodology.  The course focuses on recent methodological writing, though a few classical pieces are also included.  The readings are not specific to any substantive subfield in political science or sociology.  The course assumes no prior background in qualitative methodology, but the material is advanced.\n\nThis course is taught with POLI_SCI 490-0",

    "overview": "Obeah. Santeria. Vodou. These African traditional religions were forged in the political and economic cauldron of the Caribbean, because of the transatlantic slave trade. Going beyond the tropes of reggae and beaches--this course offers a critical introduction to central themes in Caribbean Studies. We will survey the history, culture, and religious traditions of the Caribbean region with attention to the following questions: What are the major themes in studying religious traditions in the Caribbean? What are the cosmological and embodied expressions that characterize religious practices in the Caribbean? How was religion mobilized by enslaved and free Caribbean subjects and to what ends? How have historical and contemporary actors characterized religion and culture in the Caribbean? What kind of insights do we gain by engaging the history, politics, and culture of the Caribbean through the lens of religious studies? We will approach these questions through scholarly texts, film, literature, and music. Themes such as belonging, migration, colonialism, race, gender, and class will guide our understanding of what makes these religious expressions uniquely Caribbean.",

To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fuṣḥā will be used in reading and writing; an educated spoken version of the āmmiyya of the Levantine dialect will be used to develop speaking and listening skills we will be using.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world. \n\nArabic 121-1, taught in the Fall quarter, is the first quarter of second-year Arabic and will build on material covered and practiced during first-year Arabic (the 111 sequence).",

    "overview": "After a series of revolutions and revolts over the course of the century from 1789-1871, the city of Paris came to be seen by French government officials as a dangerous incubator of subversive ideas and movements. The government responded both by beginning to produce a wealth of knowledge about the city through practices of cartography, policing, and other forms of surveillance, and through policies of urban planning intended to enable the free circulation of capital and military forces through the streets. In this course, we will interrogate the relationship of literature and film to these forms of state knowledge production about the city of Paris across the 19th century and in the period from 1945 to the present. To what extent did representations of the city in modern and contemporary literature and film align with the state project of mapping the city and its inhabitants? How did literature function as a space of contestation of the modernization of the city, both through modeling non-normative practices of the use of urban space and in memorializing the spaces and communities impacted by state violence? How have literature and film participated in the struggle over who belongs in Paris, especially around questions of class and race? Authors and directors studied include Gaboriau, Baudelaire, Maspero, and Diop, along with archival documents and shorter excerpts from authors like Balzac, Perec, and Varda. Taught in French",

Students will explore how hedge funds evaluate these opportunities and capitalize on them to drive returns for their investors. The course will help students understand the concept of arbitrage and the limits of arbitrage opportunities.\nThere will be a particular focus on asking why outsized returns exist in specific cases of market inefficiency. Students will be exposed to a myriad of potential root causes including counterparty risk, liquidity risk, and investor segmentation. Through the course, students will learn how to price and evaluate a wide variety of financial instruments including depository receipts, credit default swaps, convertible bonds, and distressed debt.\nThe aim of the course is to give students several examples of bona fide market inefficiency and give them the tools to assess (and potentially capitalize on) future market opportunities in real-time.  Will we talk about more recent events like WSB/Gamestop and not-so-recent events like the implosion of LTCM.\nSome Interesting Questions We Will Explore in This Class:",

    "overview": "This course focuses on leisure and popular culture in Palestine/The land of Israel during the first half of the 20th century. The course examines the emergence of new leisure forms, sites, and practices and probes how local, regional, and global events shaped the cultural life of both Jewish and Arab societies and their intercultural relations. Throughout the course, we will discuss cafés, cinemas, beaches, nightlife, theatre, and sports venues as spaces of both intercommunal encounters and friction. We will examine how broad historical processes such as modernization, urbanization, the emergence of national identities, and the evolving national conflict between the Arab and Jewish communities shaped local leisure patterns. Also, we will analyze the interrelationship between leisure and other social constructs such as work, family, community, and nation. How did categories of ethnicity, gender, and class organize and reshape institutions and practices of leisure culture and vice versa? The course combines a wide range of primary sources as well as cultural products of Jewish and Arab writers, moviemakers, and artists. Through course readings, lectures, discussions, and collaborative assignments, students will confront the many ways in which leisure had a foundational impact on ordinary people's daily lives and the formation of collective identities in 20th-century Palestine \\ Israel.",

We will learn from linguistic studies which factors support or impede accuracy in listening for second language learners, including those related to the listener, the speaker(s), and the speech environment. We will address perception of sound contrasts in US English that may not be present in other world languages. Students will practice listening to rapid and/or reduced speech, speech in noisy environments, multi-speaker conversations, and to speakers of different dialects of English to build confidence and competence. Students will also learn sociolinguistic strategies for interactions in which listening may be especially challenging. Active participation and evidence of progress towards proficiency must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

The former tells the story of an apocalyptic civil war within a ruling dynasty that comes to engulf all of the peoples of the world. The latter tells the story of the righteous king, Rāma, and the abduction of his beloved wife, Sītā, by the demon-king Rāvaṇa. Both stories have edified audiences, in different versions, for over two-millennia, and both are considered by many to be sacred texts that reveal deep truths about the nature of human existence. \n\nIn this course, we will read abridged translations of the classical Sanskrit versions of both stories, reflect on their meaning, and explore their continuing significance in different forms to audiences today.",

    "overview": "In the United States, we often talk about Latinx people using blurry labels. We discuss the Latino vote, the Hispanic population, and the Latinx community. This course explores the nuances of these labels through stories narrated by Latinx authors. As we follow characters through conflicts and inhabit their quotidian lives, we will navigate between the specificity of a story and the complexity of a Latinx identity. Class discussions will study emotional ties to language, feminist thought, Latinx Indigeneities, and queer storytelling. Our readings will alternate between short stories, poetry, non-fiction writing, and one novel. As we move between forms and genres, we will pay particular attention to what Latinx authors achieve by choosing to tell their story in a poem, a short story, an essay, or a novel, as well as what each of these forms asks of us as readers.\n\nA nine-week course cannot do justice to the rich genealogy of Latinx writing. This course follows an illustrative sample of Latinx authors from the 1980s to the present. It aims to provide students with a historical, political, and literary foundation for further exploration of Latinx literature.",

The goal is for you to understand why these books are so praised - what sets them above other novels - and to derive wisdom from them.  These books address life's ultimate questions - is there such a thing as objective good and evil, how shall we understand love and its role in life, what makes a life meaningful, and similar questions these novels are known for considering with profundity otherwise unobtainable.   If the course works, you will see why great literature is worth the effort while acquiring skills to understand it better on your own.",

    "overview": "This course examines the recent past that most US history courses never get around to discussing. The course surveys the rise and fall of market values--often called neoliberalism--in the United States (and around the world) over the past half-century to explain such pressing problems as rising inequality, mass incarceration, mass immigration, party polarization, political extremism, and social isolation. It focuses on politics and policy but also attends to society and culture. Along the way it considers the specific risks and rewards of studying the recent past, asking what sources we can rely on, where is the line and what is the relationship between history and the present, and how can history help us to understand and respond to present day problems? The course begins with the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 and ends with the election of Donald Trump in 2016, arguing that each of these moments marked the end of one social and political order and the rise of another. No prior collegiate coursework in US history is required.",

    "overview": "Sailors played a paradoxical role in France's empire. On the one hand, they were the agents of empire, spreading French civilization throughout the world. On the other, they were often drawn from the lower classes of society, and from Brittany, a region of France that was itself a kind of colonized space, where residents mostly spoke Breton rather than French. The sailor was also closely associated with supposedly asocial behaviors: criminality, same-sex sexuality, rampant non-monogamous heterosexuality, and interracial relationships. In this class, we will explore these paradoxes of the figure of the sailor in French literature and film of the 19th and 20th centuries, through the works of Jules Verne, Pierre Loti, Jean Epstein, Ousmane Sembène, and R. F. Fassbinder.",

The course follows the integrated approach which blends the standard Arabic, Fuṣḥā, and the dialect or colloquial language, āmmiyya, in a way that reflects the authentic practice of native Arabic speakers. To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fuṣḥā.  To develop speaking and listening skills we will be using an educated spoken version of the āmmiyya of the Levantine dialect.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world.  \n\nArabic 111-1, taught in the Fall Quarter, is the first quarter of first-year Arabic.  Topics covered during this quarter are: The writing system (alphabet); the number system; and about 200 basic everyday words covering self-identification, family, work, the weather, transportation, clothing, colors, and food.",

Central questions of the seminar include: How do social categories of difference determine disease and health in individuals and collectivities? How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others? The course will provide advanced instruction in anthropological and related social scientific research methods as they apply to questions of social inequality and public health policy. he course draws from historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, public health literature, media reports, and films.",

    "overview": "Topic: Bioinsecurities: Race and Colonialism in Global Science Fiction\n\nThis reading-intensive first year seminar will consider how colonialism and contagion together produce racialization in science fiction. In the year of the pandemic, European nations voted for strict vaccine export control measures, effectively slowing down access to medications for the Global South. Phrases like \"vaccine nationalism\" as well as \"vaccine passports\" have become commonplace. This twilight zone of deepening crises, and the imperial paranoid imaginary of what Neel Ahuja calls \"bioinsecurities,\" have long been represented by science fiction authors. Keeping a firm eye on epidemiology, race, and imperialism, this course charts a path along genre-bending, speculative fictions that imagine contagion and infection not just as disease but as racialized others from the late-nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. Contagion emerges not just as a moral panic or embodied paranoia about infection, but as a method of relationality that draws tightly controlled, governmentalized worlds around raced and differentiated bodies. We will think about how these fictional netherworlds produce new subjectivities of life, death, and living death. Alongside science fictional as well as speculative novels, spanning postcolonial, British as well as multiethnic US writing, we will also watch films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Night of the Living Dead, District 9, Arrival.\n\nBut that's not the only agenda for this course: on the way, we will simultaneously encounter SF that offers us important insights on the question of race and empire more broadly, i.e. narratives that don't necessarily take contagion as their point of departure but are key in understanding racialization and the postcolony. Similarly, while the course is largely organized around science fiction, we will also ask what it might mean to think about speculative fiction or realism alongside SF. Thus, we will encounter texts that are thinking more abstractly about difference in order to understand different registers of SF.",

    "overview": "At its core, international law is an idea about how to use the tools of law and legal systems to facilitate peaceful and mutually beneficial relations in the world. This course explores how the international legal system works from a legal and political perspective, shaping international relations today. The course introduces some aspects of the method and substance of international law, such as concepts like sovereign immunity, jus cogens, customary international law, general principles of international law, principles of jurisdiction etc. This is not a law course; we cover legal subjects to understand how politics and law interact in shaping international relations today. Substantively, the course examines international laws related to the oceans, the environment, human rights, trade and war. We read treaties, and use case studies to see how international law is made, why national governments and national courts at times contest international law, and why international law can be difficult to enforce. We explore the legal and political issues surrounding contemporary flashpoints in international relations: China's claims to the South China Seas, how civil conflict is fueling the poaching of elephants, the United States Supreme Court's ambivalence regarding international law, how international law regarding torture is and is not politically relevant.",

The topics we will cover include, among others: the status of women around the world, education, marriage, fertility, labor supply, household decision-making, and discrimination. The class will put an emphasis on applied microeconomic theory and empirical analysis. A combination of econometric techniques and theoretical models will feature prominently in the course. For each topic, we will study concrete examples emanating from all over the world, and make an intensive use of statistics and econometrics. We are also very much interested in understanding the relationship between research and public policy. By the end of the quarter you hopefully will have a solid microeconomic framework within which to analyze important issues in economics from a gender perspective.",

    "overview": "This is an intermediate level three-quarter sequence in which students will continue to advance their proficiency in Arabic language and learn more about the culture and the people of the Middle East. The course follows the integrated approach which blends the standard Arabic, Fuṣḥā, and the dialect or colloquial language, āmmiyya, in a way that reflects the authentic practice of native Arabic speakers. The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world. The course will enhance learners' ability to read, write, understand and discuss challenging authentic Arabic text from different sources. Readings may include various textual resources from newspapers, magazines, journal articles, audio and video clips, short stories and other relevant material. \n\nWe will continue to work with Arabiyyat Al-Naas, Volume two, second edition. We will do some review of salient features of chapters 1,2,3 and 4 and then cover chapters 5, 6,7 and 8 in our textbook. The topics are Food and Drink, Arab Music, The Arab Woman, and Politics and Human Rights.",

    "overview": "While those going into the field of mental health typically think about it as a \"helping profession\", there is much more than meets the eye when it comes to the psychological, economic, and political forces that have defined the development of the field. The course will focus on the contemporary framework for defining mental illness - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its 5th edition) - with a particular focus on some of the problems that have emerged from the disease-based framework utilized in the manual, and the assumptions that it makes about disorders and typical development. We will explore the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and we will examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, with additional consideration of the contemporary implications of the closing of state hospitals. Finally, the course will focus on the evolution of psychotherapy in the modern marketplace, and some of the challenges posed by the demands of the health insurance industry and academic research. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally and the implications of culture for diagnosis will also be discussed. Along the way, we will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, and modern psychiatry. Some of these themes will also be explored through analysis of popular films and other media. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class attendance and participation, co-leading a class discussion with peers, and writing assignments including short reaction papers and a longer research paper.",

    "overview": "This course focuses on a particular market failure - monopoly - in the context of antitrust law, public utility regulation, network effects, and intellectual property. First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of platforms featuring network effects that result in a small number of operating systems, streaming services or social networks. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law. Throughout the course we will explore the general topic of regulation and industry cases, both current and historical.",

Why have slavery and settler colonialism been so important to so many constitutional and state histories? This course takes up these and other questions in order to make sense of the interplay between laws and empires around the world over the last five centuries (circa 1500 to 2000). We will examine: 1) the origins and effects of mixed jurisdictions (or legal pluralism) in different regions; 2) the ways empires have shaped key concepts of sovereignty, personhood, and citizenship; 3) the role of transnational corporations in bolstering imperial rule; 4) the roots of empire in the history of human rights and global governance; 5) tensions between scientific and legal definitions of race and ancestry; 6) histories of Islamic law; 7) entanglements between cultural and intellectual property; and 8) shifting legal definitions of indigeneity.",

We will explore historical and contemporary structures of inequality in the US, particularly related to race, gender, and class, and we will critically reflect on our own positions within these structures.",

In this course we will examine the importance of material culture in human life past and present.  We will ask, how can objects shape our world?  Can objects have agency? And how can material objects teach us about human social worlds?  We will approach the topic of material culture from anthropological, archeological, and multidisciplinary perspective to examine the broad significance of material culture for people.  Bringing in perspectives from various disciplines that come together in the emerging field of material culture studies, we will explore the materials that surround and are made meaningful through their mobilization in human social worlds.",

    "overview": "Women and Textiles\n\nThis course examines woman artists of the twentieth century who worked with textiles—as fine art, as collective industrial production, and as craft. Textiles were historically associated with \"women's work\" and domestic life and not taken seriously as art. We will investigate such topics as the modernist artists of the 1910s-1930s who challenged this division between craft and high art, such as Anni Albers at the Bauhaus, Sonia Delaunay in Paris, Liubov Popova of the Soviet avant-garde, and Norwegian Hannah Ryggen's acclaimed narrative tapestries; the female collectives of industrial textile designers of mid-century Italy and the Soviet Union (with a focus on acclaimed designer Anna Andreeva); the feminist artists of the 1960s and 1970s who upended the masculine art world status quo through their shared knowledge of traditional and experimental textile techniques, such as Faith Ringgold, Harmony Hammond, Miriam Schapiro and the Womanhouse collective; and throughout, the particular importance of textiles to speak to stories of exclusion and marginalization for artists of color and indigenous artists.\n\n*Course under review for FD-HS and FD-LA",

The topics covered in this course will include Pareto efficiency, social choice, general equilibrium, risk and uncertainty, game theory (including Cournot and Bertrand competition), asymmetric information, and mechanism design. The main goal of the course is to teach students how to apply economic concepts to better understand economic reality. After taking this course, students should be well equipped to analyze simple microeconomic systems using mathematical modeling and basic economic concepts such as efficiency and equilibrium. The course also aspires to teach students how to think like an economist, by appreciating the role of preferences, information, and incentives in the analysis of human interactions.",

We will consider how film and other moving image technologies have reflected historical moments and shaped cultural discourses in modern Japan. Focusing on films that raise disciplinary questions related to both the cinematic medium and Japan, we will examine, among other topics, the era of silent cinema; the relationship between nationhood and the formation of a \"national\" cinema; technological transformations and the coming of sound; the wartime period; cinema during the occupation; and 1950s modernism. We will also study the place of important individual directors - Ozu, Mizoguchi, and Kurosawa - within the broader economic and institutional contexts of Japanese cinema and its global circulation.  Students will learn how to critically analyze various films from multiple theoretical perspectives while gaining an understanding of the major figures and movements in the history of Japanese cinema.

    "overview": "This course is for students interested in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and Pedagogy, Digital Humanities vis-à-vis language teaching, teaching assistantships, professional education, and generally those interested in working with languages in academia. Slavic 405 is intended to introduce students to the major trends, theories, and scholarship of Applied Linguistics and SLA, as particularly addresses the complexities of teaching Russian (and upon interest, other Slavic languages) with respect to heritage and non-heritage language learners. We also explore some tools in Digital Humanities (DH) and look at the growing trend of language learning with MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) and hybrid or blended teaching. The seminar will be a \"hands-on\" course, requiring the active participation of all attending. Students will learn how to work with and apply to language teaching the more popular forms of technology often used in language, literature, and culture teaching, including Canvas, Power Point, and also DH tools such as Voyant, Omeka, and others.",

    "overview": "In our current social and political environment, the nature of truth is often contested. Many institutions once widely regarded as objective purveyors of fact have fallen from grace in the eyes of a distrustful public. In what some refer to as a \"post-truth era,\" public confidence in institutions is now at an all-time low, and many feel that personal beliefs, emotions, and opinions overshadow fact in popular discourse. \n\nIn this first-year seminar, \"Truth, Truthiness, and Trust in Age of Deepfakes,\" we will consider the psychological mechanisms underlying judgments of truth, as well as socio-political factors that help shape our (dis)trust in information. Drawing from psychology and related fields (including sociology, philosophy, legal studies, and communication sciences), we will explore how emerging technologies, such as AI-generated \"deepfakes,\" challenge traditional notions of evidence and reality. Through readings, discussions, and written assignments, students will develop a critical understanding of how humans perceive and engage with information in the social environment. We will engage in reflective thinking about our own judgments and explore potential avenues for addressing the erosion of trust and spread of misinformation in society.",

The principal topics include the later Middle Ages, Renaissance, Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Enlightenment.  Geographical emphasis will be on Western Europe, primarily England, France, Germany and Italy.  An attempt will be made to retain a balance in topical coverage, rather than focusing exclusively on any one topic such as political, social, economic or cultural history.",

    "overview": "This seminar will consider art works engaged in labor politics and, moreover, artmaking as itself a form of labor. Starting with the claim that artistic production is distinct because, unlike working for wages, it manifests unalienated labor, we will go on to look at how art adopts, approximates, resists, romanticizes, etc., such moments in modern labor history as deskilling, the replacement of guilds by unions, the rise of the professional managerial class (PMC) and ultimately the current scourge of neoliberal precarity. We will examine the affinities or lack thereof between artmaking and not just blue and white collar work but the affective and cognitive labor (\"pink collar\" work) so crucial to the newly dominant service economy. Finally, we will weigh arguments that artists are indeed members of the managerial PMC and therefore actually antagonistic toward the working classes.",

    "overview": "This course introduces students to the social, political, legal, and cultural history of immigration in the United States. In addition to exploring the history of southern and eastern European immigrants, it uses a comparative framework to integrate Latin American and Asian migrants into our understanding of immigration since the late nineteenth century. The course is an exploration of major themes in immigration history rather than a comprehensive examination. Issues students will consider include immigration law, acculturation, community, racial formation, victimization vs. agency, religion, politics, gender, the transnational and international context of immigration, and competing notions of citizenship/nationality, among others. \n\nAttendance is mandatory on the first day of class.",

    "overview": "How did computers become globally ubiquitous? Should we thank—or perhaps blame—isolated geniuses who toiled away in Silicon Valley? Or were our digital devices forged through geopolitics, international organizations, and world wars? This course will seek to answer these questions by analyzing the global development of modern computing from the nineteenth century to the present. In addition to looking at the technological and cultural contributions of the United States, we will spotlight the interconnected global nature of computing's history. By illuminating connections others have missed, we will see that the internet didn't connect the globe; rather, an interconnected world formed modern computing. To this end, participants will investigate how the Information Age was shaped through state planning in the Global South, Cold War competition, Japan's postwar growth, and the worldwide extraction of silica sand and quartz. Students will emerge from the seminar with both an appreciation of computing's historical highlights and an analytical framework for understanding how digital developments transcended borders and reconfigured the global community.",

Each week, we will relate one (or two) films with a work of recent critical theory that illuminates different aspects of the neoliberal reality in the region from the 80s to the present: privatization and dispossession, domestic labor and exploitation, growing slums and processes of urban self-determination, economic crises and growing grassroots economies, among other subjects. We will explore how Latin American filmmakers have turned to experimental modes of cinematography -particularly documentary approaches- to capture the daily lives, conflicts, political situations, and dignities of the region's urban inhabitants. This way, these films bring to the screen reflections on Latin America that dialogue with critical concepts such as baroque economies (Verónica Gago), cuir territoriality (Tadeo Cervantes), survival circuits (Saskia Sassen), or the multitude (Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri). As a project for this class, students will create a short documentary video on the Latinx Chicago.  Prerequisite: 1 course from SPANISH 250-0, SPANISH 251-0, SPANISH 260-0, or SPANISH 261-0.",

Together, we will review scientific studies on the impact of college life on student academic performance, and correlate those findings with studies of human and animal learning in the laboratory. After taking this course, you will have a foundational understanding of the neurobiological basis of memory, learn how to read scientific literature critically, and develop strategies to improve your study habits and performance here at Northwestern University.",

    "overview": "The history of reproduction is a large subject, and during this course we will touch on many, but by no means all, of what can be considered as part of this history. Our focus will be on human reproduction, considering the vantage points of both healthcare practitioners and lay women and men. We will look at ideas concerning fertility, conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, birth control, abortion, and assisted reproduction. Because, at a fundamental level, reproduction is about power - as historian Amy Kaler (but by no means only Kaler), pointed out, \"[c]control over human reproduction is eternally contested, in zones ranging from the comparative privacy of the conjugal bedroom to the political platform and programs of national polities\" - we will pay attention to power in reproductive health. And, since the distribution of power in matters of reproduction has often been uneven and unequal - between men and women, between colonizing and Indigenous populations, between clinicians and lay people, between those in upper socioeconomic classes and those in lower socioeconomic classes - we will pay particular attention during this class to struggles over matters of reproduction as we explore historical changes and continuities in reproduction globally since 1900. \n\nFulfills Area IV (Historical Studies) distribution requirement",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "We're Here, We're Queer: Queer Narratives in Israel\n\nThe corpus of Hebrew prose works and cultural representations that focus on LGBT characters and queer life stories is on the rise. Such texts and films are no longer inherently considered completely marginal, despite not yet being a major part of the literary canon. This course presents a broad examination of LGBT/queer Hebrew literature and culture - from the new wave of gay and lesbian literature in the 1990s up to some more contemporary works. What stories and questions do Hebrew queer literary texts and films present? Is queerness in the Israeli context being celebrated or is it still fighting for acceptance and tolerance? Throughout the course, we will explore Israeli prose works and films that engage with LGBT/queer identities and topics, and examine questions and themes, such as \"coming out of the closet,\" \"queer identity,\" \"the lesbian continuum,\" \"heteronormativity/ homonormativity,\" and the queer notion of \"no future.\" The literary and cultural texts will be accompanied by theoretical texts from Adrienne Rich, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lee Edelman, J. Halberstam, and more. No previous knowledge of Hebrew is required! All the Hebrew texts will be read in translation, and all the films will be accompanied by English subtitles.",

How do we know that tests like the n-back task, implicit association test, or fMRI studies produce evidence about memory, implicit attitudes, or emotional states? Psychologists appeal to tools of scientific reasoning, such as validation, construct development, and operational definitions, to evaluate when methods provide evidence about the objects of inquiry.   We will analyze these tools as well as typical methods employed in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. These methods include: introspection, comparative animal research, controlled lab experiments, and functional neuroimaging. Using this analysis as background, we will evaluate particular cases of scientific reasoning about animal cognition, implicit bias, short-term and spatial memory, and moral judgment. At the end of this course, we will evaluate the role of replication and integration of results in producing knowledge about the mind/brain.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

The first half of the course will consider definitions of the patron, the question of patronage and agency and theories of collecting. In the second half of the course students will select an individual patron connected to the well-documented Valois family and present weekly on their relationship to various types of art making.",

This course will examine the breadth of the Hindu traditions as they have developed over time, highlighting the major elements that characterize them collectively, such as ritual sacrifice (yajña), world renunciation (saṃnyāsa), law (dharma), spiritual discipline (yoga), devotion (bhakti), worship (pūjā), and theology. During the course we will explore both the scriptures of Hinduism as well as its practices.
