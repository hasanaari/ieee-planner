    "overview": "This seminar explores the political, social, and economic intricacies of American housing policy, with an eye towards better understanding current-day U.S. housing challenges and crises. Students will examine historical developments, the origins and consequences of key legislation, and the role of government and political processes at the local, state, and federal levels. Students will examine how various stakeholders - including elected officials, policymakers, interest groups, and local communities - shape the political possibilities for housing reform. Topics covered will include affordable housing, zoning, suburbanization, the role of the private sector and government-sponsored enterprises, and the interplay between race, class, and housing access. By the end of the course, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the political forces shaping housing in the United States and their broader implications and consider innovative solutions to the greatest challenges in this important policy area.",

    "overview": "How does the built environment shape social meaning and reflect historical change? In this introductory-level course, we will survey the human designed environment across the globe, from 1400 to the present day. Through in-depth analysis of buildings, cities, landscapes, and interiors, we will observe how spatial environments are created and invested with meaning. From Tenochtitlan, riverine capital of the Aztec empire, to the Forbidden City in Beijing and the Palazzo Medici in Florence, from the Palace of Rudolf Manga Bell in Douala to the Colonial Office of the Bank of London, and from Lina Bo Bardi's Glass House in SÃ£o Paulo to David Adjaye's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., this course will introduce students to the changing technologies, materials, uses, and aesthetics that have helped define architecture's modernity across time and geographies. Through detailed visual analysis and the study of primary source documents, students will become familiar with architectural terminology and historical techniques of architectural visualization. Through written exercises and guided slow looking, students will learn how to critically analyze and historically interpret the built environment at various scales.",

    "overview": "\"Gender \u0026 Politics\"\n\nThis class will investigate how gender shapes politics and policy, and how these in turn shape gender, primarily in the United States. I aim also to provide comparative and global context. Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. We examine some of the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States, with class input on which issues to explore. \n\nThe course readings feature different types of materials - original documents, scholarly books and articles, a textbook, policy reports, popular non-fiction work on aspects of gender, policy, politics and society. These are supplemented by films and online resources.\n\nThis course is cross-listed with GNDR_ST 331-0-20 and POLI_SCI 337-0-1.",

    "overview": "As a critical methods seminar for English majors and minors, English 300 will enhance your interpretive, analytic, and argumentative skills.  To that end, this class explores new ways to read Jane Austen in both her historical context and our contemporary moment.  Whether you're a stranger to Austen or a devoted Janeite, this class will give you surprising insights into her connections to the social, domestic, and aesthetic movements of her time.  We will pair three Austen texts with three earlier novels:  Pride and Prejudice and Mary Hays's radical feminist novel The Victim of Prejudice (1799); Emma and Daniel Defoe's criminal autobiography Moll Flanders (1722); Northanger Abbey and the mass-popular Gothic novel A Sicilian Romance (1790) by Ann Radcliffe.  We'll accompany each pairing with critical texts in contemporary feminism and queer studies; narratology; and genre studies (on the Gothic).  The class will conclude by looking at some contemporary TV or film renderings of Austen (e.g., Bridgerton, Clueless, or Pride and Prejudice).    \n\nAttendance at first class meeting is mandatory.",

    "overview": "The Occupy Wall Street protests gave us the powerful imagery of the 99 vs. the 1 percent. The world was confronted with the question \"How democratic are our democracies?\" When wealth, power, and privilege are distributed so unequally, how much does one-person, one-vote really matter? Theories of oligarchs and elites help us make sense of \"participatory inequality,\" or even \"domination through democracy.\" This seminar takes on these important topics. We will examine a range of cases and countries, with a special emphasis on the US, where elite theory arose and oligarchic theory has re-emerged. Is there a relationship between rising inequality and rising polarization within democracies? Students will find this seminar highly relevant to modern political issues.",

We will read classic theories of realism by Hegel, Auerbach, Barthes, LukÃ¡cs, Blumenberg, and others, as well as significant new work by contemporary critics and theorists, together with exemplary texts of nineteenth-century European realist prose fiction. The temporal focus of the class will be mid- to late-nineteenth-century Europe and the particular literary form that dominated at this time; however, we will also go beyond this to look at the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of the notion of \"realism\" itself. Special attention will be devoted to the following questions: the purpose of genre, the place of the human, the relationship between realism and reality (or the real), the elevation of the ordinary, and the possibilities and limits of representation.",

    "overview": "In this course, we will study some of the major figures in early analytic philosophy. The basic orientation of the course is systematic, although the historical emergence of the ideas will structure the order of studying the figures in the seminar. The main systematic motives are the idea to solve traditional problems of modern philosophy by logical and linguistic analysis, which yields the basic features associated with the linguistic turn in philosophical methodology. Another theme is the ânaturalizing' idea that the role of philosophy is that of at most a partner (if not a part) of science. The leading question tying together both is how the notion of what it is to be meaningful and representing the world correctly changes throughout a stepwise process of philosophical elucidation. Some especially illuminating and important part of the work done in the period called âthe age of analysis' was done by women philosophers whose contributions were over time (after WW II was fought by the men) unjustly \"forgotten\" from the canonical texts taken as characterizing the main insights of analytic philosophy. One aim of the course is to set the canon right on this score by including women philosophers' contributions in the emerging discussions over the role, power, and limits of analysis as a method. On the whole, the course aims at illustrating how in the course of analysis genuinely philosophical problems and issues (from conditions of knowledge of the world and other minds to those for norms and judgments of evaluative correctness) made their way from a transcendental domain into the reach of human reason, and thus opened philosophers (and contemporary thinking) up to unprecedented solutions and promises of revolutionary re-conceptions of what it takes for human beings to represent, know, and orient ourselves in the world.",

How do various individuals experience and make sense of being on death row? What do people write while incarcerated and why? Students in this first-year seminar will engage with these questions through an exploration of the writings of incarcerated individuals on death row and socio-legal scholarship on incarceration more broadly. This course has a particular focus on the genre of prison writing, employing various types of writing, including autobiographies, poetry, letters, and podcasts. By examining these texts, students will explore the issues of capital punishment and mass incarceration more broadly. A primary goal of this class is to sharpen students' writing skills. We will balance reading assignments with various short writing assignments and three essays.",

Students will read various forms of literature and policy documents to assess the extent to which Marxist theory is central to the interpretation of \"religion\" in Communist China. Primary sources will include Chinese constitutional articles, white papers, and editorials in English translation. Secondary sources will cover a wide range of interpretations and perspectives on the position of religious institutions and religious practices in the PRC. \n\nThe first part of this course will investigate the expression of religiosity under Communism in China; the rehabilitation of Confucian values; the constitutional protection of religion and religious belief in China; the relationship between ethnicity and religious policies; the Sinicization of religion; and the administration of the five officially accepted religious traditions in the People's Republic of China (Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Islam). \n\nThe second part of the course will focus on the recent cases related to the Muslim Uyghurs of Xinjiang and the Tibetan Buddhists of Western China. The class will explore some of the most controversial issues related to these two ethnic minorities including terrorism, religious violence, nationalism, assimilation, foreign influence, and soft power. The course format will consist of both lectures and discussions, during which students will be encouraged to exercise critical thinking and lead in-class presentations. Students will analyze various types of documents, critically evaluate content and concepts, and endeavor to synthetize the information and communicate it effectively and thoroughly.",

    "overview": "The meaning of a declarative sentence is a proposition, a representation of an object at a time. That representation is built out of the meanings of the individual words in a sentence. So when a declarative is sentence is used by a speaker, a proposition is communicated. However, in many contexts, additional propositions are communicated by a speaker's use of a sentence. These propositions go beyond the sentence's meaning, and are the result of a hearer drawing inferences based on what the speaker said in conjunction with other considerations. These are  pragmatic inferences.  This class is about how they are derived, what distinguishes them, and how to explain them. We will consider inferences derived with considerations about the speaker's cooperativity (implicatures), inferences derived with facts about the broader structure of the discourse (elicitures), inferences derived from world knowledge that seem to enrich a sentence's meaning (implicitures), and more. Depending on interest, we will also consider pragmatic inferences in connection with topics like deception, narrative, and testimony.",

    "overview": "Recent controversies about \"fake news\" and disinformation would appear to suggest that contemporary mass media is newly unreliable. This course will explore how the distinction between truth and fiction in all media technologies has always been muddy. To do so, we will examine fiction that pretends to be true from 17th-19th century literature and philosophy to documentary-styled novels, films, and radio programs that span the 20th century. We will study the predominance of \"found footage\" films and digital media in the current millennium that parallel the rise of reality television, YouTube, and the smart phone. We will begin and end the quarter with considerations of \"fake news,\" from founding father Benjamin Franklin's fabricated newspaper propaganda to contemporary digital media. We will also read selections from philosophy and critical theory that question the concept of truth and the construction of reality through media technologies.",

    "overview": "Gender studies have traditionally focused on women. Yet critical work on men and masculinities show us how people of all genders are impacted by gender expectations and assumptions. Furthermore, studies of masculinities shed light on practical questions like, why do men die earlier than women? And, why are men more likely to commit mass shootings? In recent years, the public spotlight has cast light on savory and unsavory aspects of masculinity; think about the rise of the term \"toxic masculinity,\" the #MeToo movement, advertisements aimed at men, and blogs commenting on the behavior of men on the reality show The Bachelorette. In this course, we will go beyond banal statements like \"men are trash\" to critically ask, What role does masculinity play in social life? How is masculinity produced, and are there different ways to be masculine? This course provides students with an intensive introduction to the foundational theory and research in the field of masculinities studies. We will use an intersectional lens to study the ways in which the concept and lived experience of masculinity are shaped by economic, social, cultural, and political forces. As we study the institutions that socialize people into gender, we will examine how the gendered social order influences the way people of all genders perform masculinity as well as the ways men perceive themselves, people of other genders, and social situations. Verbally and in writing, students will develop an argument about the way contemporary masculinity is constructed and performed.\n\nThis course is cross-listed with GNDR_ST 232-0-20",

This class will elaborate the iterative conception of sets, its relationship to the standard ZFC axioms, and will develop the theory of infinite ordinals and cardinals with the goal of establishing classical independence results.\n\nContact Prof. S.

At its height, their empire extended from Hungary to Korea, and from Siberia to Burma. This course introduces students to the empire's history - from the Mongols' harsh living conditions as nomads in the Mongolian Steppe to Chinggis Khan's rise to power and extraordinary military success, which facilitated the Mongol Empire's near universal expansion. We will explore how the Mongols ruled over diverse geographical regions and populations, and the impact their expansion had on the territories they ruled and further beyond. We will read sources in translation and discuss how European, Chinese, Arabic and Persian authors viewed the Mongols, but also what we can learn from the Secret History of the Mongols, the Mongols' account of the establishment of their empire.\n\nIn the past few decades, the image of the Mongols in modern scholarship has changed: no longer only brutal yet highly effective nomadic conquerors, they are recognized also as cultural agents responsible for fostering cross-cultural encounters and facilitating inter-Eurasian exchanges of knowledge and expertise, from warfare to astronomy and medicine. We will explore the results of the transmission and mobility of people, objects, technologies, and ideas between China, the Middle East, and Europe during this era.",

Upon satisfactory completion of the course, students are expected to be able to handle various types of more complex daily conversational situations and short passages on familiar topics. Successful completion of CHINESE 121-3 will satisfy the WCAS foreign language requirement. In addition, they will reach Intermediate mid to Intermediate high in reading, writing, listening and speaking according to ACTFL proficiency guidelines.",

    "overview": "The course will introduce students to metaphysical and epistemological issues raised by modern natural science. We will be guided by nested \"what does it take\"-questions. For example: What does it take for natural science to be -in societies with a scientific cultureâthe legitimate authority on matters of fact about nature? What does it take for a system of assertions to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by evidence like observational and experimental data (and: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data, observations, experimental results?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to contemporary discussions on the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality, the problem of realism. This will include reflecting on reasons philosophers of science have established against some common preconceptions about what it takes to be entitled to scientific objectivity, such as that science provides âproof', or that there is one simple, context-free âscientific method', or that scientific objectivity is free of considerations of values or informed judgment. Many contemporary doubt-manufacturers selectively use parts of such reasons to suggest the skeptical attitude that science produces just one among many optional beliefs about reality, and that others (like religion, or what serves the oil industry) are equally valid. Against this, we will see that the reasons against proof as the standard (and in favor of evidential support and fallibility) in fact  don't weaken but instead strengthen the justifications of why we ought to trust scientifically formed belief where it and its institutional and social conditions are available more than any other (purported) sources of information on nature.",

    "overview": "Mexican and Chicanx oral traditions remember the Indigenous interpreter who led HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s through Mesoamerica by the name of La Malinche. In the five centuries since her death, she has become a symbol for treachery, a seductress that sided with the enemy of her people for personal gain. This course takes the myth of La Malinche as a starting point to consider the construction of gender that underlies Chicanx and Mexican identities. It considers female and queer writers from the twentieth and twenty first centuries who have sought to reframe women's roles in Chicanx and Mexican storytelling. We will read stories about traitors, witches, and madwomen; stories that center language as our main instrument to fabricate and rupture gender roles. Our discussions will pay particular attention to the literary traditions that authors take up to narrate the unsettling reality of gender-based violence: surrealism, horror stories, realist fiction, and hybrid forms. We will consider how feminist reformulations of horror, surrealism, and realism might respond to the male-dominated traditions of magical realism, the Chicano nationalist movement, and Mexican philosophy. We will also study the visual mediums through which generations of Chicanx feminists have celebrated their multicultural heritage as well as the protest art forms emerging from the ongoing Mexican feminist movement Ni Una Menos (Not One More). Our course materials will reveal the rich genealogy of female artists behind contemporary feminist uprisings in Mexico and in Mexican American communities.",

In addition to considering different theoretical traditions, students will also consider issues such as trustworthiness and the use of negative or deviant cases. \nâ¢ The practice of qualitative inquiry.  Students will explore sampling strategies; instrument and research design; observation and interview techniques; and a variety of approaches to data analysis and data presentation.    \nâ¢ Key issues that researchers encounter in doing qualitative research.  Students will consider a range of practical issues that they will have to deal with as researchers including access to sites and ethical issues relating to qualitative work.    \n\nThe course will be conducted as a \"clinical seminar.\"  Class work will be organized around prescribed readings on a particular issue as well as students' fieldwork.  Materials (e.g., research design, instruments, data) from students' research projects (a required assignment for this course) will be used to ground weekly discussions.",

    "overview": "This undergraduate lecture course introduces one of the most contested terms of art historical inquiry today: modernism. Broadly, the term refers to the collective efforts of cultural producers to respond to the ever-shifting conditions of perception and social life brought on by modernity. The course examines some of the key moments in global modernity from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century. It provides a critical introduction to the rise of modern art practices from a range of locales, pushing against the hegemonic discourses upholding the Western canon to underscore the interdependencies between the Global North and the Global South.\n\nFrom anti-colonial modernism in India to considerations of race and modernism in mid-century Jamaica, this course takes seriously the diversity of experiences of global modernity by examining movements and moments formed in opposition to the ravages of capitalism, colonialism, industrialization, imperialism, and war that continue to define our world. We will examine how the aesthetic of newness, ideas of \"progress,\" and radical formal invention characteristic of modernism were rooted in the societal transformation of modernity. The work of the course contests the idea of modernism as a purely European or American phenomenon while considering artists' efforts to elaborate internationalist artistic languages, reflecting and refracting the concurrent rise of the modern nation-state. Across the quarter, we will focus on how modernist traditions transformed through their circulation across cities, nations, and continental borders. The overarching goal of this course is the consideration of how the formal concerns of distinct movements in modern art, responding to modernization, emerged out of specific historical and cultural contexts and how each movement pushed against the tastes of society at large to radically challenge ideas about art itself.",

We routinely ingest, for example, infographics about demographic trends, media coverage on crime and undocumented immigration, and advertisements for ancestry tests. In complex and contextually specific ways, this diet shapes our personal and collective identities, social interactions and relationships, and political aspirations and anxieties. In this course, we endeavor to study the politics of racial knowledgeâthe ways in which categories, measurements, and other techniques of knowledge production have helped to constitute \"race\" as a seemingly objective, natural demarcation among human populations and institute forms of racial domination and inequality. Historically, racial knowledge has stipulated and legitimated what we might describe as a kind of racial ontology, a set of assumptions, claims, and prescriptions about race and racial superiority/inferiorityâe.g. the notion that \"whites\" or \"the West\" represent the apex of human civilization.\n\nDrawing on diverse texts, this course explores of the emergence, evolution, and effects of racial knowledge. This exploration will begin by discussing the historical relationship between the modern concept of race and European colonialism and slavery. Subsequently, we will track several major developments in the history of racial knowledge, from Enlightenment naturalists to censuses to contemporary genomics research.",

How has Christianity been shaped by cultures around the world, and how has it shaped those cultures in return?\n\nThis class explores Christianity from a perspective of religious diversity. Using case studies from documentaries, podcasts, scriptures, scholarly articles, short stories, music videos, and films, students will encounter a variety of Christian lifeways, practices, beliefs, and identities. They will consider how important concepts in Christianityâlike faith, sacrifice, and sanctityâhave been variously defined and experienced across Christian communities. We will ask what factors account for the broad range of Christian doctrines and denominations, and analyze the anxieties, conflicts, and points of creativity have arisen out of this diversity.",

    "overview": "Sociology is a field of study that examines how people and groups interact, navigate, and make decisions within the structure and constraints of their social world. Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?\n\nSociology is a huge field of study, and includes an enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

This course will think about how we read literature and film by focusing on these figures and how they're represented. How do we understand the historical transformation of the representation of Asians in American culture past and present? How can focusing on \"types\" and \"stereotypes\" assist us in thinking about how we read and interpret literature and film more generally?  How do we explain and grapple with the seeming inevitability of types and stereotypes in cultural representations? The main literary texts we will be reading are Maxine Hong Kinston's classic novel Woman Warrior, Peter Hessler's nonfiction River Town, and Yiyun Li's short stories collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers. We will also analyze the 2018 romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Jon M. Chu.",

Rowling and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie have taken stances against trans people, and the increasing popularity of \"Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism\" and \"Gender Critical Feminism,\" \"trans\" and \"feminism\" are in fact historically co-constitutive. In this course, we will trace that history to answer the questions: should feminism intervene in trans rights? And, should trans and non-binary people be considered the proper subject of feminism? We will explore text, documentary, and film that provide insights into trans feminism's roots in lesbian and gay liberation movements of the 1970s and in woman of color feminisms; we will also consider the early feminist debates of Trans Studies as an emergent academic discipline in the 1990s and 2000s. In the second half of the course, we will expand trans and feminism beyond the US context to consider decolonial trans* feminisms globally, with special emphasis on trans* discourses in Latin America. Students will leave this course with a better understanding of the complexity and importance of trans feminisms as a world-building framework, as well as their legacies and futures; students will also have ample opportunities to explore their own trans feminist praxis.",

Rather, innovation requires a collaborative team and a leader who can build an organization that is willing and able to share knowledge, resolve differences, and learn together.\n\nThis course is designed for undergraduates who want to understand transformational leadership and the unique role that leaders play in nurturing teams to problem-solve, collaborate, and continuously innovate.\n\nWe will examine leadership and the impact of leadership styles on team effectiveness, drawing from theories and case studies, as well as our personal experiences. We will explore organizational culture, motivation, conflict management, and communication. Finally, we will develop our own approaches to leadership as we tackle innovation work - whether in the classroom as students or in the industry as future entrepreneurs and executives.",

    "overview": "This course focuses on the invisible universe at radio wavelengths for non-science and \nscience majors. The night sky, the Sun and the solar system planets appear very different \nwhen observed with radio telescopes.  Studying the invisible universe provides an awe in the \ndiversity of phenomena that our universe offers.  The realm of the invisible includes the \ncomponents of the fascinating history of radio astronomy, and numerous discoveries over the \nlast 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, the Big Bang background radiation, organic molecules) \nand fundamental differences between visible and invisible night sky. \n \nBefore 1931, the study of the universe was limited to optical observations of the night sky. \nKarl Jansky changed everything by building a radio telescope that could observe the sky day \nor night. We are all familiar with radio frequencies by listening to FM radio stations and \nusing GPS satellites for navigation. Radio astronomy is the study of natural radio emission \nfrom celestial objects at frequencies outside FM and GPS frequencies. The human eye can see \noptical light but is blind to radio signals, including those that provide important clues \nabout the history of our universe. The radio band is very broad, spanning 100,000 Hz between \n10^7 to 10^12 Hz, whereas our eyes are only sensitive between red and blue, a factor of two. \nThis course discusses new tools to unveil the `hidden' sky over a wide range of frequencies \nin ways that can not be viewed or understood in the optical frequencies.",

    "overview": "The World Health Organization declared the end of the COVID-19 pandemic on May 11, 2023âthree years and change after it began. Most of us continue to experience the aftermath of the pandemic in various ways.* Primary and secondary school students continue to lag behind grade level by as much as nine months; commercial zones in major urban areas remain empty as remote working arrangements persist; millions of families grieve for lives lost to the novel coronavirus; and millions more contend with the effects of long COVID. In short, even as the epidemiological threat of the SARS-COV-2 virus has waned, the sociocultural impact of this worldwide crisis has just begun to come into focus. Having spent three years in involuntary training as amateur epidemiologists, we can now turn to the humanistic disciplinesâwhich analyze the processes and products of human cultureâto take stock of what this experience has meant for our values, our outlook, our relationships, and our culture. In that spirit, this course will investigate plague literature over the longue durÃ©eânearly seven centuries, from 1348 C.E.-2023 C.E.âto explore the diversity of human experience in relation to plague and pestilence as represented in the Western/Anglophone canon.** Guiding questions will include: how have different groups of people searched for answers about the mechanisms and the meanings of plague (in medicine, in religion, in moral philosophy)? how have cultures responded to death rates so high that they defy traditional rituals of mourning and memorialization? what underlying prejudices, suspicions, and other social ills tend to be activated by pandemics, and to what effect? what role does literature play in helping us to formulate, and sometimes to answer, these questions and others?\n\nCourse readings are divided into three units: medieval and early modern Europe, from Boccaccio to Daniel Dafoe; literature of the U.S. AIDS epidemic, including Tony Kushner and Sapphire; and a final unit on contemporary literature, featuring presentiments of and responses to COVID-19 from Ling Ma, Carmen MarÃ­a Machado, and Michael Cunningham. Assignments will include collective annotations on Canvas, podcast episodes (produced in small groups), Canvas Discussions, and a final essay or creative project. \n\n*As well as other crisesâpolitical, financial, moral, ethical, educational, racial, economic, and so onâbut there are only ten weeks in the quarter. \n**The primary sources for this course were almost all composed in English; those originally composed in another language have been translated so widely as to occupy space in the Anglophone canon despite their origins in another linguistic tradition.",

    "overview": "In the territory currently called the United States of America, healthcare for Native populations is often experienced as a tension between settler colonial domination and activism among Native nations to uphold their Indigenous sovereignty. This reading-intensive, discussion-based seminar will provide students with a complex and in-depth understanding of the historical and contemporary policies and systems created for, by, and in collaboration with Native nations. In order to understand the U.S. government's role and responsibility towards Native nations, we will delve into legal foundations of the trust responsibility and fiduciary obligation of the federal government as outlined in the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court decisions. To understand how Native nations continuously work within and resist colonial settler systems to exercise their sovereignty, students will examine notable federal and state policies that affect Native health, wellbeing, and (lack of) access to meaningful care.",

    "overview": "Rapid changes in our media landscape (special effects, virtual reality, AI) have at once expanded and challenged our sense of reality. This course returns to a pivotal moment in the history of audiovisual media when, in the aftermath of World War II, cinema tested its own capacity to show the world as it is. The development of the film movement known as Italian Neorealism marked a profound shift worldwide by bringing to the screen issues of freedom and social justice and adopting a language that heavily relied on documentary techniques. Films such as Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City (1945) and Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1947) have been influential for generations of filmmakers in countries as diverse as Brazil, France, India, Iran, Senegal, and the United States. This course will explore the history of neorealism and its aftermath from a transnational perspective, starting with the movement's own spurious origins. We will follow how the neorealist approach developed under diverse geopolitical conditions and adapted itself to document and even participate in struggles for liberation, equality, and socioeconomic justice. While reading key texts in film and cultural studies, we will watch and analyze films by renowned directors such as Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Charles Burnett, Jean-Luc Godard, Abbas Kiarostami, Ousmane SembÃ¨ne, and Jia Zhangke.",

    "overview": "The phrase \"rule of law\" conveys a range of expectations we have of government and each other. Is the rule of law a meaningful aspiration for a legal system that is fair and ensures everyone, including government officials are equally accountable? Or is the phrase a cynical ruse on behalf of the powerful to control wealth, territory, and populations? This course will explore the origins of the rule of law in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law and politics. The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Max Weber, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives. \n\nThis class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?\n\nPlease note that there are no formal prerequisites, but students who have not had previous classes in political theory may find this class challenging. POLI_SCI 201 or equivalent would be helpful.\n\nPOLI_SCI 309-0 and LEGAL_ST 309-0 are taught together; may not receive credit for both courses.",

    "overview": "This course will allow you to explore how fiction works. We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

This course will also cover the theory and application of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). To make this course interesting and accessible to both novice and experts in NMR spectroscopy, we will select for each topic classic and/or representative papers that will accompany each class, so that each student can choose the depth of their study that may go beyond the class material. The class will also include interactive and practical exercises, including the use of Topspin, NMR Data Analysis Software for assignments, Collaborative Computational Project (CCPN) and the solid-state NMR simulation software SIMPSON. The homework will be to read the assigned papers. Each student will be assigned the discussant for a few select topics to post Q\u0026A. The final exam will be a written report on a topic of choice in NMR spectroscopy. This is a graduate level course and will be designed to benefit the student's research directly or indirectly.",

Students will significantly increase their knowledge of Italy's history and culture and they will be guided to become independent learners. After the completion of the entire sequence of Italian 102, students will be eligible to study in Italy and will be ready to embark on the minor or major in Italian. The second-year Italian course sequence completes the two-year WCAS language requirement. The classroom is very lively, with lots of conversation, partnering, and small group exercises.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will be asynchronous.",

In particular, we will closely consider the differences between social kinds, social norms, conventions, and other kinds of social facts. To explore these topics, we will take an interdisciplinary path. We will anchor the conversation in philosophy but weave in and out of the social and cognitive sciences while considering how and why different regularities seem to hold. In addition to understanding how regularities obtain, we will also focus on how to change such regularities when they are harmful or oppressive to members of a group.",

    "overview": "This studio course explores textiles as a medium for artmaking. Drawing inspiration from contemporary artists who use fiber in their work, students will create flat and sculptural pieces, moving from the wall/bed/floor to the room/body. Basic hand-stitching and machine-sewing methods will be introduced and frame looms constructed for weekly weavings. Focus will be placed on tactile learning: materials will be salvaged, deconstructed, pieced, mixed, embellished and re-imagined as art objects. Due to the often slow and additive nature of textile work, students will engage in multiple simultaneous projects throughout the quarter. Readings and discussions will focus on themes such as craft, labor, utility, gender, identity and the vernacular. Thinking through making will be encouraged as will explorations of the potential for metaphor and subversion inherent in fiber-based practices. Field trips include outings to a thrift store to source materials and to the Art Institute of Chicago to see Jeremy Frey: Woven. Additionally, Chicago-based artist kg (karolina gnatowski) will visit to share about their work and process. Students are welcome to bring their personal fiber-based skills and traditions to class, but no experience is necessary, and no prerequisites are required.",

These varied productions of knowledge will help us understand how norms of ethnicity, race, class, nationality, and gender shape Latina/e femmes. Our discussions, activities, and projects will be guided by intersectional traditions of Black feminist scholarship, woman of color feminism, and queer of color critique to provoke further questions about how Latina/e femme sexualities are represented and lived.

    "overview": "This course will explore how scholars represent states reproducing, maintaining, or destroying a particular body politic. In doing so we will engage theories of \"biopolitics\" and \"biopower,\" broadly conceived. The objective is to understand the uses and disadvantages of Michel Foucault's critiques of discourses of sovereignty for analyzing current political conflicts situated in practices of the nation, race, class, and the family, as well as the subject positions associated with these, e.g., citizens, immigrants, Whites, Asians, rich, poor the 1%, dependents, women, men, LGBT, queer, and many more. The course will attend to the intellectual and political history informing Foucault's critiques of, and elaborations on, the discourse of sovereignty, including legal discourses. During class meetings we will discuss Foucault's historical periodizations of changing discourses of power/knowledge relations associated with biopolitics and evaluate the metanarrative that informs his heuristics. Lectures will discuss the readings in the context of Foucault's own intellectual history. The class will read extensively from works by Foucault as well as texts by Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, Nancy Fraser, Bruno Perreau, Jacques RanciÃ¨re, Ann Stoler, and others. Students are encouraged to reflect on how the readings are in conversation with their own research interests and highlight these in class.",

    "overview": "In this course, a trained tutor provides individualized language study for the purpose of increasing nonnative speakers' proficiency in English, in both academic and everyday contexts. At the beginning of the term, students will complete a needs assessment to determine which aspects of spoken English are most critical for current communication skills. These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "Scams. Frauds. Cheats. Conspirators. Con-artists. Stories of fake heiresses, fraudulent corporations, pyramid schemes, and tech industry hucksters have captured audiences and sparked widespread fascination with deception in the modern world. However, the history of scamming and literature about scammers stretches far beyond the present day, with roots in classic works like Herman Melville's The Confidence-Man, the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz (as well as the characters of Wicked!), and even F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. \n\nWhat explains this centuries long fascination with \"the con\"? This course will examine a range of literature, film, and TV shows that explore scams and scammers, tracing the cultural obsession with these stories. We will analyze both historic and contemporary views on scamming, interrogating what these tales reveal about human nature, power, and society. From the traditional cons of the past to the more complex digital and financial frauds of today we'll examine how these scams challenge our notions of trust and authenticity. Ultimately, we'll question what our ongoing obsession with these figures says about the modern world, and why we seem so drawn to stories of manipulation, illusion, and moral ambiguity.",

Her research specialization is in the ancient Maya civilization where she has been working as an archaeologist for the past 40 years. She is interested in using archaeology as a tool to explore the everyday lives of ordinary people to show how the lives of ordinary people make an impact on human societies. She has recently completed research at the ancient Maya farming community of Chan in Belize, Central America which was occupied for 2000 years from 800 BC to AD 1200 (http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/subfields/archaeology/chan/index.html). The people who lived at Chan were ordinary farmers and the goal of research at Chan is to explore the importance of farmersÂ¿ everyday lives. Starting in summer 2015, she is embarking on a new research project at the ancient Maya city of Aventura, also in Belize. Aventura is a city that survived the Maya collapse and may hold answers to how humans can create sustainable cities.",

    "overview": "In this course students will examine the logic of inquiry in archaeology: the theories, methods, major epistemologies, and philosophies of archaeology.  We will address two fundamental questions: Why is important to study the past?  What is the role of the past in the present?  Understanding our history and our heritage is crucial for the world today and key to understanding past ways of life.  The course frames archaeology within anthropology and the humanities and sciences more broadly and examines the role of anthropology, humanities, and science within the discipline of archaeology.  It addresses contemporary archaeological research and its promise for the future.\nArchaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.  A central focus of the course is on materiality as an archaeological method and a method that can be applied broadly within anthropology.  Archaeology is a team-based, participatory discipline, a methodology of practice that has important implications for how archaeologists can work in partnership with local communities and address contemporary issues.  Ethical, contemporary, and practice-based discussions will interweave across the course.  In this course students will develop an original research project that applies archaeological approaches to material culture in their own research.",

Retrosynthetic analysis, substructure keying, and pattern recognition, along with other methods for synthetic planning will be discussed within the context of specific case studies. Classic and modern organic reactions, including asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, will be introduced and their application in synthetic planning examined. Case studies will include the synthesis of terpenes, alkaloids, polyketides, steroids, proteins and pharmaceuticals. The end result should be that students are familiar with the important issues associated with synthesis and gain intimate knowledge of a wide variety of chemical reactions. Ultimately, when presented with a given molecule, students should be able to develop a reasonable synthesis plan based on firm ideas and reliable transformations.",

Instead, we will be focusing on how archaeologists think about key environmental concepts, including climate change, sustainability, and resilience.  We will discuss examples of \"failure\" and \"success\" in the long history of human-environment interactions, and see if there's room for nuance along the way.  We will also use this course as an opportunity to consider how archaeology can contribute to current environmental sustainability and environmental justice efforts.  Prior coursework in archaeology is not required to appreciate this class or do well, but would be helpful.",

    "overview": "Romantic Comedies, Old and New\n\nDoes the popular genre of the romantic comedy continually renegotiate the social contract? Or do its \"happy endings\" continually impose the safety of closure on love's wayward digressions? This course maps the literary and cinematic DNA of the contemporary \"rom com,\" from William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and the screwball comedies of 1930s Classical Hollywood to the 1990s blockbusters and the Netflix revolution. Along the way we may ask: What do the comedic conventions of Western classical drama, the medieval genre of \"romance,\" or the political aesthetics of Romanticism have to do with the romantic comedy as it exists today? The anarchic space of the \"comedy\" genre is often understood to house a subversive potential, using absurdism or satire to scramble power dynamics or to question social norms governing gender, sexuality, race, and family. One standout question for us will be: Does the romantic comedy threaten to tame the comedy genre's subversive potential? Or does it promise to release its chaotic energies in ever renewed ways? Why do some literary forms and characters seem endlessly adaptable for different social subjects; and how does a screen actor's \"star text\" or public image help direct the genre's history? Students will regularly be asked to watch two movies in a single week. Evaluations are based on participation and preparation; writing several short papers, film analyses, \u0026 response posts; presentation on an episode, scene, or clip from a recent TV show that helps us understood the genre and its history; and a final exam.",

The first part of the course will focus on the persecution of Jews during the first half of the 20th century culminating in their genocide between 1939-1945. We will discuss Nazi ideology; the complex interface between the Nazi regime's espousal of racism and the motivation of perpetrators on the ground; the interface between politics and law; the victims' reactions to persecution; conditions of life in the ghettos and camps; the response of the international community; and the aftermath of the war. In the second part of the course, we will examine Israeli society's different and even contradicting attitudes toward the Holocaust. We will probe how the establishment of the State of Israel, the 1950s mass immigration, and the evolving Arab-Israeli conflict shaped Israelis' understanding and memory of the Holocaust.",

Drawing from literary texts and various \"Asian\" cultural exports to America, this course will explore questions of race and capital in today's context of emerging Asian superpowers and the decline of US hegemony. Far from representing an unchanging ancient culture, the \"Asianness\" of each scene of example maps out military and economic historiesâand futuresâthat stretch across the transpacific. Taking cues from Asian American writers such as Ed Park, Hsi Tseng Tsiang, and Esther Yi, we will work together to deconstruct the ways in which race becomes legible as a product of Asian/American encounters in the \"Asian Century.\" The primary objective of this course is to help you become more critical and generous as a reader and interlocuter. As we approach writing as a process that is never complete nor perfect, this course will help you refine skills of argumentation, the incorporation of quotes, organization, and revision.",

The course will cover formal schools of thought about the natural worldâfrom Transcendentalism to the conservation and environmental movementsâbut also discuss the many informal intersections of human activity and natural systems, from European colonialism to property regimes, migration and transportation, industry, consumer practices, war, technological innovation, political ideology, and food production",

We will also engage practical questions such as: What is the relationship between race and health?; Do we have good reasons to prescribe medications in accordance with race?; Is it moral to believe that humans are divided into races?; What ought we to do with race and race-talk given overriding moral concerns?; Are implicit racial biases morally condemnable?; How does race and racial perceptions impact law?; and Is racism permanent?",

The focus is on the generation and architecture of major theories in the field. The concepts and analyses contained in these readings provide essential building blocks for you to pursue further reading on your own and in other courses in comparative politics and political economy. Key topics include the formation of capitalism and the modern nation-state, revolutions, the role of structure and agency in major political change, materialist versus ideational and institutionalist interpretations of politics, political economy, nationalism, dictatorship and democracy, and oligarchs and elites. Students across all subfields of political science have found this seminar useful, as have students of history, sociology, and anthropology. It offers an important first step toward preparing for the qualifying exam in Comparative Politics.",

    "overview": "Science is often considered a value-free enterprise. Scientists work in labs following the scientific method and provide society with relevant scientific facts. Policymakers then decide, based on their values, how to act on these facts. However, this picture does not fit the social sciences.    Social scientists study social phenomena that seem to be defined according to particular social values. Well-being is something that is good for you, divorce is bad for you. Economists use models that make unrealistic assumptions about human behavior, yet still predict market outcomes. International indicators assess which countries have the most gendered violence, but key types of violence are left out so that more countries will report their data. Climate scientists must decide how to communicate their climate predictions (including their likelihood and the severity of their consequences) to policy makers and the public.   In this course, we will evaluate methods such as economic games, sociological indicators, idealized economic models, self-report surveys, causal analysis of big data, and generative AI. In each case, we will assess to what extent these methods help us provide knowledge about our social world.",

    "overview": "This seminar will work across Shakespeare's genres (comedies, tragedies, and tragicomic hybrids), reading representative plays that show Shakespeare's preoccupation with humanity's cosmic place and his assessment of an ambivalent environmental situation for human beings. For critical context, shorter readings - from Genesis to the Anthropocene - will fuel our discussion.\n\nThe course will explore Shakespeare's troubled sense that humankind, alone among all creaturely kinds, does not quite \"belong\" to nature. We'll assess how his understanding of \"Nature\" and our relation to it changes over time and how it varies in the distinct ecologies of tragedy and comedy. The critical concept of Shakespearean \"green worlds\" first arose to describe the retreats into nature (and away from civilized society) that typically occur in the comedies. In Shakespearean comedy, a removal to the green world (getting ourselves \"back to Nature\") counteracts one or another social ill, which in turn enables a rebalanced, healthier socio-political life to be restored. But how does this traditional and sometimes pastoral sense of a natural equilibrium hold up in a closer reading of the plays, especially if we consider comedies and tragedies together? Against what, exactly, is the human social order defined and established, and from what threatening \"laws of nature\" is it supposed to defend us? How does our grasp of more contemporary human impacts on the environment illuminate Shakespeare's premodern vision of human existence as a calamity of exposure - to both hard weather and our own worst instincts? This inquiry into Shakespeare's environmental vision will, finally, tell us something about the longer philosophical history of wondering what it means to be human.",

    "overview": "This class will investigate how gender shapes politics and policy, and how these in turn shape gender, in the United States and other countries, situated in global context. Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. And, finally, we will take advantage of the fact that we are in the middle of an election to examine some of the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States.\n\nThe course readings feature different types of materials - original documents, scholarly books and articles, a textbook, policy reports, popular non-fiction work on aspects of gender, policy, politics and society. These are supplemented by films and online resources.",

    "overview": "This graduate seminar in Black Studies is a transdisciplinary exploration of new and emerging technologies and their pivotal intersection with racial systems of power, disparity, and ethics in the context of democracy, colonialism, and public interest. Through rigorous analysis of race, futurity, and technology, students will examine the social, ethical, and geopolitical dimensions of Artificial Intelligence, genomics, precision medicine, AI weaponization, climate and environmental justice, and the geopolitics of technology, particularly as they relate to pan-Africanism and global Black communities. By engaging with theoretical frameworks and critical case studies from fields such as science and technology studies, critical race theory, and ethics, students will not only critique technological practices but will also explore the solution space for addressing complex societal challenges. This course invites students to imagine democratic futures that prioritize equity and social justice in an increasingly technology-driven world.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs.\n\nThis course is the first in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will meet asynchronously.",

    "overview": "The scripts and fragments from plays produced in fifth-century BCE Athens in honor of Dionysos, god of wine and theater, are among the most enduring and powerful legacies of ancient Greek culture. Since their rediscovery in the early modern period, directors, translators, and adapters have repeatedly turned to the poetry of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to reflect on political, ethical, social, and theological issues of their time. Most recently, the plays have proved fertile ground for directors eager to imagine alternative ways of thinking about race, gender, and class. We will read a selection of Athenian tragedies, with special emphasis on their form, ancient performance context, and themes, as well as select examples of contemporary adaptations. All readings will be in translation, and students will be encouraged to work in groups to perform and develop creative responses to individual scenes.",

We will survey and discuss several historical events and fictional representations from the colonial period to the present in order to understand how these narratives have contributed to the construction of national identities and, at the same time, excluded other possibilities of self-figuration, expression and political organization. Our approach will be both historical and cultural: on the one hand, we will analyze how popular and indigenous myths can be read as distinct ways of relating to the past and understanding history. On the other hand, we will look at how and why certain historical events attain the status of myths or legends, and certain historical figures the status of myths or icons. By doing so, we will consider myths both as a way of understanding the past and a way of concealing its historical realities. Includes English or Portuguese discussion sections. Prerequisite for Portuguese discussion section: PORT 201-0, PORT 202-0, or sufficient score on placement exam. Prerequisite for English discussion section: none.",

    "overview": "Media Times\nTime, World, Power: this course explores how audiovisual technologies have contributed to ordering the world by ordering time. We will start by considering the ways cinema has contributed to reshaping the very idea of time in conjunction with the expansion of capitalism, industrialization, and colonial rule; to remapping the world according to standards of temporal calculation and synchronization; to turning the dictum \"time is money\" into a maxim of subject formation at the very level of the sensorium. We will then consider how this logic of temporal control has mutated with the diffusion of digital technologies and under the pressure of finance capitalism. But we will also attend to the ways specific cinematic practices have resisted or subverted this logic and pointed in the direction of non-hierarchical forms of differentiation. Texts from film and media theory, feminist/queer theory, critical race theory, post-autonomist Marxism.

    "overview": "When the rappers of Migos say their girl is \"bad and boujee,\" what exactly do they mean? For those uninitiated in the world of African American vernacular (AAV) , being bad is not always good thing. Yet, as many Black women know, being called \"bad\" is a compliment that speaks to not only appearance but a general aura that transcends language. The term boujee, a shortened version of bourgeois, is an insult for women who are seen as too high maintenance or demanding of the finer things in life. Yet, boujee can also be a desirable trait highlighting a woman's aspirational status. In this class, we will look at the multiple meanings of these terms in both their positive and negative connotations to critically engage the intersections between class, race, and gender in Black women's writing. Reading across a range of sources, including poetry, prose fiction, music and film, produced from 1900 to today, we will look at women who are imagined outside of the norms of Black American sociality: \"fast\" girls in New York City who were arrested for being too \"wayward,\" queer femmes who attempted to build relationships with each other rather than their husbands, and girls abandoned by their mothers that have to learn how to be bad all by themselves. Ultimately, we will assess the promise and peril that characterize Black women as bad and boujee. Texts for this class may include:, Toni Morrison's short story \"Recitatif\" (1983), Audre Lorde's Sister Outsider (1984), Bridgett Davis' Naked Acts (1997), and Claudia Rankine's Citizen (2014), Jazmin Sullivan's Heaux Tales (2021).",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "\"Make It New\": Ezra Pound translated this famous slogan from an ancient Chinese inscription: \"As the\nsun makes it new / Day by day make it new.\" What is \"it\"? What inspires poets' \"making\"? What makes\na poem \"new\"? These questions open broad reaches on the vast river of poetic traditions, materials,\ntechniques, and experiences that poets navigated during the long, turbulent twentieth century,\narticulating poetic aims, theories, principles, and manifestos as they went. Thus Baudelaire sings the\npainter of modern life; Eliot urges poets to cultivate a historical sense, a knowledge of past literature, so\nas to seize what is new in their own moment; for William Carlos Williams, \"So much depends / upon / a\nred wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.\" Studying works by a range of\npoets, we'll see how poems emerge in creative dialogue with other poems within and across historical\nmoments, locales, languages, cultural surrounds, and sensibilities. We'll hone our close reading, analytic,\nand comparative skills as we think, talk, and write about the imaginative, formal, and linguistic virtuosity\nof poems-as-worlds that enrich the resources of English poetry: verse lines and forms, sound patterns\n(meter, rhythm, music, tone), diction, rhetoric, figurative language, personae, voices, visual arrangement.\nWe'll seek to deepen our powers as readers of modern poetry by appreciating poetic form and technique,\nthe infinite play of language, and the poets' situations, voices, addressees, audiences. We'll end with a\nPoetry Fest at which everyone chooses and reads, recites, or performs a poem for the class.",

The course is based on Hebrew from Scratch, a comprehensive textbook with grammar and interactive exercise for the beginning adult learner.    \n.   \nHebrew 111-2, taught in the Winter Quarter, builds on material learned in the first quarter. You will learn the impersonal form widely used in everyday Hebrew, adjectives and more question words, as well as numbers, and the direct object, a unique form in Hebrew.  All these new words and structures will be integrated into short texts and lively conversations which are part of the wider context of Israeli culture.  As always, students will have ample opportunities to practice and expand all skills.",

In this course, we will think with our stomachs as we explore food-writing genres such as recipes, short stories, memoirs, reviews, political pamphlets, and academic essays to learn how to evaluate and emulate effective prose across styles and disciplines. \n\nThis course will feature texts by Michael W. Twitty, Anthony Bourdain, Michael Pollan, Ruth Ozeki, and bell hooks, among others. We will also analyze and respond to non-textual food media such as food documentaries, Studio Ghibli films, and cooking TikToks. \n\nAs we read, write, and eat, we'll consider such questions as: What is the relationship between the food and the writing that we consume? How have food texts and concepts such as celebrity chefs, cultural appropriation, and copyright transformed in the era of social media? How do historical and contemporary food struggles for sustainability and food sovereignty translate onto the written page?\n \nCourse assignments will develop flexible writing skills such as voice, argumentation, and research through adaptable assignments including the restaurant review, recipe narrative, and creative research project. This course is designed to use the many modes of food writing as a foundation for critical reading, writing, and research skills that will help you to thrive as a reader, writer, and consumer!",

And yet romantic and erotic desire are the very motors not only of social relations but of narratives and fiction. In great novels, we as readers hang as much on the outcome of romantic entanglements as we do on the solution of crimes. How do our desires and the characters' desires entwine in the phenomenon we call \"narrative desire?\" And what are the dangers of identifying with the characters and outcomes of a supremely \"plotted\" world? We will look at three classic novels in which the dangers of desire are figured, variously, as perversity, faith, sexual violence, betrayal, and blood addiction!",

    "overview": "This seminar will bring together literary texts from the English Renaissance, ancient and Renaissance theories of spectatorship and catharsis, and academic criticism and theory on contemporary horror fiction and film. Juxtaposing theoretical texts ranging from Aristotle to Carol Clover, we will consider the ways in which early modern narratives and theatrical productions anticipate horror fiction and film of the 20th and 21st centuries. Across three main unitsâon revenge tragedy, witches, and monstersâwe will consider what psychological, cultural, and civic functions are served by the publication and performance of horror. Methodologically, we will consider the validity and value of a diachronic approach that juxtaposes Renaissance and contemporary texts without relying on direct and documentable examples of authorial influence.\n\nThe following books will be available for purchase at Norris; other assigned reading will be available for download on Canvas. You may substitute alternate editions of textsâincluding facsimiles available through EEBO or online editions available through NU Libraryâso long as you're willing to contend with different sets of explanatory notes, page numbers, and so on.",

Starting from the discussion of power - a key concept in political science - we will understand how power exerted via the media affects politics, how new forms of power arise because of changes in the modern media and media technologies, and how various actors are vying to harness media power. Our geographic scope is global, given the worldwide reach of these technologies. We will examine how various regimes differ in their adoption and utilization of these technologies, how a variety of new actors arise on the political scene to challenge existing regimes, and how actors fail or succeed in their usage and incorporation of media/technologies. Among the key issues we will explore is the power to influence perception, the power to influence emotions, and the power to control narratives. We will see how thinkers and scholars understand these issues from a variety of perspectives, both old and new.",

We will study the geographies of the Mediterranean Seaâincluding Italy, Spain, Egypt, North Africa, the Balkans, Anatolia, the Holy Land, and the Middle Eastâfocusing on their rulers, kingdoms, merchants, craftsmen, pilgrims, and travelers in order to explore the means and spread of artistic and architectural patronage across the area. We also will explore the role of art and architecture in the sacred and secular lives of the region's Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities. Among others, we will learn about monuments (architecture, mosaics, wall paintings), objects (ceramics, metalwares, coins, and textiles), and historical texts to better understand the medieval Mediterranean's artistic, cultural, and political dynamics.",

    "overview": "When first hearing the word \"gothic,\" most would not think of Black authors and visual artists. However, and as acknowledged by several scholars, including the Nobel Prize-winning Toni Morrison, race and particularly Blackness has always been inextricable from American Gothic literature. This course will consider Morrison's claim to explore some early canonical gothic texts by Edgar Allan Poe and Kate Chopin as a foil for how Black authors and artists take up issues of haunting, monstrosity, and corporeal threat since the nineteenth century.\n\nWhile we will spend a little time with white American authors, the center of this class is the production by Black artists. We will begin with the American \"slave narrative,\" stories by fugitive and formerly enslaved Black people. Also, we will look at nineteenth-century gothic fiction and poetry by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Pauline E. Hopkins, Adah Isaacs Menken, W.E.B. DuBois, and Charles Chesnutt. We will also read some twentieth-century gothic texts by Toni Morrison, Tananarive Due, and others. Finally, we will reach outside of the US and look at work by Caribbean and South African writers. The class will also include film, music, and visual art. The core questions of this course will include: how the gothic genre succeeds and fails for Black artists; the connections between race, slavery/apartheid, and the gothic; and the relationships between memory, history, and horror in the US and Caribbean.\n\nCome to class ready to enthusiastically discuss myriad issues concerning race, gender, class, and sexuality.",

The course is comprised of three modules.  In the first module students will be introduced to the history of the development of the field of Black Studies and its connections to longstanding struggles for self-possessed Black educational spaces, diasporic and transnational movements shaped by Black intellectuals interrogating structures of power and disempowerment, as well as pedagogic practices regarding education as a political resource for social change.  With a grounding in some of the broad historical currents shaping the history of the field and people of African descent in the Americas and across the African Diaspora, in Module II, students will be introduced to foundational concepts and intellectual frameworks that have shaped the field and continue to animate critical debates in Black Studies.  In the final module, students will actively engage a host of contemporary issues shaping cutting-edge research in the field including work on environmental and climate justice, abolitionist world-making, social-movement building in the digital age, queer Black life on screen, and race and medicine.   In doing so, students will encounter the complexities of Black life and its discontents and the dynamic nature of the histories and cultures of populations of the Black Diaspora.",

    "overview": "Mexican and Chicanx oral traditions remember the Indigenous interpreter who led HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s through Mesoamerica by the name of La Malinche. In the five centuries since her death, she has become a symbol for treachery, a seductress that sided with the enemy of her people for personal gain. This course takes the myth of La Malinche as a starting point to consider the construction of gender that underlies Chicanx and Mexican identities. It considers female and queer writers from the twentieth and twenty first centuries who have sought to reframe women's roles in Chicanx and Mexican storytelling. We will read stories about traitors, witches, and madwomen; stories that center language as our main instrument to fabricate and rupture gender roles. Our discussions will pay particular attention to the literary traditions that authors take up to narrate the unsettling reality of gender-based violence: surrealism, horror stories, realist fiction, and hybrid forms. We will consider how feminist reformulations of horror, surrealism, and realism might respond to the male-dominated traditions of magical realism, the Chicano nationalist movement, and Mexican philosophy. We will also study the visual mediums through which generations of Chicanx feminists have celebrated their multicultural heritage as well as the protest art forms emerging from the ongoing Mexican feminist movement Ni Una Menos (Not One More). Our course materials will reveal the rich genealogy of female artists behind contemporary feminist uprisings in Mexico and in Mexican American communities.",

    "overview": "What does psychology look like in practice? How does one uncover psychological phenomena? What are the controversies in the field of psychology, and how might we as researchers overcome them? This course covers the how of psychological research. Scaffolded by the scientific method and informed by contemporary challenges and controversies in the field of psychology, we will work in small research teams to empirically investigate a psychological topic of interest from start to finish. This includes brainstorming a study, conducting a literature review, designing an experiment, considering the ethical constraints, recruiting participants and collecting data, analyzing said data, and writing up and disseminating the findings. In the first part of the class, we will complete two mini research projects before jumping into our own independent research projects for the latter half of the class. The entire class is project-oriented and hands-on, and feedback and support are provided at every step. As we engage in our research projects, we will also become acquainted with psychological research issues and controversies in the field. Our class design will mirror the format of most psychology labs, as we will be expected to (and will be evaluated on our capacity to) work collaboratively and communicate with our research teams. Moreover, our major class assignments-including the APA research papers and conference presentation-are all part and parcel of the everyday work of a psychology researcher.",

Is being born with a disability a harm? Is being a child good for you? How much freedom should the state afford teenagers? How can college change you for better or worse? What are the moral duties of pregnant persons? What do parents owe their children? Is living a good life incompatible with living a moral life? What would it mean for your life to go well anyway? What is the \"midlife crisis\" and how could we navigate it? How can we age thoughtfully and what do we owe our elders? Is death bad? Would it be desirable to live forever? Via considering these questions, we will also focus on becoming clearer and more persuasive writers.\n\nT",

Its goals are twofold: first, to cultivate advanced reading skills necessary to read authentic literary materials in Japanese, and second, to develop the technical skills and metalinguistic awareness necessary to produce effective English translations. Course readings focus on representations of the city of Tokyo from the early to mid-20th century in a range of prose genres; emphasis is on gaining facility in different literary styles and linguistic registers, and on developing techniques for parsing and translating texts that demand rich contextual knowledge. Primary readings are in Japanese with discussion and theoretical readings in English.",

This course is a hybrid of the research seminar and the writing workshop, and we will confront the challenges of both researching and writing in a collaborative manner. To that end, some of our sessions will be devoted to reading and responding to one another's work. While it can be difficult and intimidating to publicly present your work, and to publicly critique or question another's work, we will undertake both in the spirit of support and assistance in the hopes of creating a community of researchers, writers, and scholars. Becoming a careful reader, responder, and recipient of constructive criticism are invaluable skills that fundamentally inform the process by which virtually all scholarly work is produced.",

    "overview": "Science is often considered a value-free enterprise. Scientists work in labs following the scientific method and provide society with relevant scientific facts. Policymakers then decide, based on their values, how to act on these facts. However, this picture does not fit the social sciences.    Social scientists study social phenomena that seem to be defined according to particular social values. Well-being is something that is good for you, divorce is bad for you. Economists use models that make unrealistic assumptions about human behavior, yet still predict market outcomes. International indicators assess which countries have the most gendered violence, but key types of violence are left out so that more countries will report their data. Climate scientists must decide how to communicate their climate predictions (including their likelihood and the severity of their consequences) to policy makers and the public.   In this course, we will evaluate methods such as economic games, sociological indicators, idealized economic models, self-report surveys, causal analysis of big data, and generative AI. In each case, we will assess to what extent these methods help us provide knowledge about our social world.",

We will discuss what the international recommendations for safely managed water are and the health and social consequences of water insecurity.   The second objective is to explore why there is such variety in water insecurity worldwide. Influences on access to water will be broadly considered; we will draw on literature in global health, ethnography, the life sciences, and public policy. These discussions will be guided by the socio-ecological framework, in which dimensions ranging from the individual to the geopolitical are considered.   The third objective is to develop critical thinking and writing abilities to reflect on the multi-dimensional causes and consequences of water insecurity and the appropriateness of potential solutions. This will be accomplished through readings and documentaries that we have lovingly selected, writing weekly reflection pieces, preparing a short in-class presentation on recent media, and writing an OpEd.",

    "overview": "Women's fiction and films of the classical Hollywood era, 1929-1950, feature heroines on the brink of madness, suicide, and death. Melodrama, a dramatic form that flourished in the nineteenth century and featured making virtue and evil visible, structures many of the works in our course. We will explore how and why female artistic production from the beginning of modernism, the Harlem Renaissance, and the heyday of the \"woman's picture,\" 1933-1950 featured women on the brink, rejecting the 19th-century \"marriage plot,\" for a different set of endings.  We will discuss the significance of \"the New Woman,\" the last throes of the \"cult of domesticity\" and the work of arguably classic Hollywood's greatest actress, Bette Davis, whose films took up those historical issues.  Mode of evaluation will be two take-home close reading exams (2 pages total) and a final project on a Davis film not on the syllabus.  Works may include The Awakening, Ethan Fromme, Sapphira and the Slave Girl, Plum Bun, Quicksand, and The Street. Films may include Of Human Bondage, Jezebel, Dark Victory, Now, Voyager, In This Our Life, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?",

    "overview": "Shakespeare's Environmental Questions\n\nThis seminar will work across Shakespeare's genres (comedies, tragedies, and tragicomic hybrids), focusing on representative plays that also show a preoccupation with humanity's cosmic place and environmental situation. The course will explore Shakespeare's persistently troubled sense that humankind, alone, does not quite \"belong\" to nature. We'll assess how his understanding of \"Nature\" and our relation to it changes over his career and also how it varies in the distinct ecologies of tragedy and comedy. The critical concept of Shakespearean \"green worlds\" first arose to describe those retreats into nature (and away from civilized society) that typically occur in the comedies. There, a removal to the \"green world\" serves to counteract one or another social ill, which in turn enables a rebalanced, healthier socio-political life to be restored. But how does this traditional and sometimes pastoral sense of a natural equilibrium hold up against a closer reading of the plays, especially if we consider comedies and tragedies together? Against what, exactly, is the human order of civil life defined and established, and from what threatening \"laws of nature\" is it supposed to defend us? How does our grasp of more contemporary human impacts on the environment illuminate Shakespeare's premodern vision of human existence as a calamity of exposure -- to hard weather and our own worst instincts, too? This inquiry into Shakespeare's environmental vision will, finally, tell us something about the history of what it has meant to be human.",

    "overview": "Beyond Bollywood: Indian Cinema after 1947\nLakshmi Padmanabhan \n\nIn the last two decades, \"Bollywood\" has become a cultural shorthand for Indian cinema as such, usually associated with elaborate song and dance sequences, plots that focus on \"family values,\" and a mass audience who worship film stars as religious icons. This class will locate the phenomenon of Bollywood cinema within the rich and complicated history of Indian cinema since the Partition of 1947, when the British colonial administration divided the region into the sovereign nation-states of Pakistan and India. We will take mainstream Indian film as a key site for reflecting on the politics of nationalism, globalization, and forms of social belonging. We will begin with Indian cinema's reflections on the affective and political aftermath of the Partition. We will then move into an analysis of the formation of gendered citizenship, generic modes, and regional cinemas. In the final unit of the course, we will address the transnational circulation of Indian cinema and the rise of Bollywood as a global brand, as well as the explosion of contemporary experimental documentary and video art, which circulate in art galleries and film festivals abroad. We will put pressure on the boundaries between \"popular\" cinema and parallel cinema, investigate the role of film in social life, and address the differences of class, race, gender, and ethnicity in the construction of the filmic text.  Students are expected to complete readings, and acquaint themselves with the history and culture of the subcontinent to prepare for the political discussions that these films engage in.",

    "overview": "Walter Benjamin's Small History of Photography\n\nThe course will explore the theory and history of the photographic medium taking as point of departure Benjamin's writings from the 1930s on. As he studied the revolutionary changes in perception that technology introduced, he became one of photography's most important and influential thinkers. Photography's relation to memory, the medium's relationship to the unconscious, the changes mechanical reproducibility introduced for our aesthetic experiences, the social and political significance it acquired as a way to understand modern life and how it facilitates as well as shapes social relations, as well as how it allegorizes embodied and cognitive processes through which we engage the world are reflections that stem from his now famous essay. Taking as a point of departure the essay's reflection on the first century of photography's history, and the corpus of both photographers (Atget, Renger Patzsch, Sander, Bossfeldt, Freund, Krull, Abbott) and photographer's historians it gathers, we explore both the critical vocabulary Benjamin develops around them as well its conceptual apparatus. We closely analyze the photobooks Benjamin reviews in his essay as well as the photobook phenomenon in interwar years globally.

    "overview": "This course is about learning how to read closely, that is, how to \"do\" a deeply informed comparative close reading. Tailored to the time constraints of the quarter, it introduces students to a series of episodes in the recent history of the study of literature and culture: the influential heroes of these episodes are engaged intellectuals who have together helped to inform how we read today. Pairing a handful of shorter primary texts with field-defining theorists and readers of the past and present, students will not only build fluency in the vocabulary of \"literary theory,\" they will emerge as more worldly, technically savvy, and theoretically sophisticated readers themselves. In this course, we are not interested in theory for its own sake, but in the ways the thing we call \"theory\" â like literature â is not only shaped by, but helps to shape the world around us.",

It is the go-to coding language for data scientists, machine learning researchers, design engineers, and anyone who needs to grab and process the vast amounts of data online, from networked sensors, or smart devices. Recently Python has become practical for coding in embedded systems, as well. Embedded microcontrollers are relevant for our annual robot design competition, NU engineering teams (Solar car, Baja), internships, and experimental apparatuses.  Our approach to coding emphasizes algorithm creation, debugging, methodical creation and partitioning in a modern notebook framework, as well as hardware-level access for microcontroller applications.

Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated.

We do so by reading short stories, poems, and articles, watching and discussing movie clips, short films and videos, and making in-class presentations. During the year we touch on a variety of themes involving South Asian culture and society, travel, literary traditions, the natural world, etc. By the end of the three-quarter sequence, students attain intermediate-mid or higher language proficiency in Hindi-Urdu.\n\nNote: Please purchase all the required textbooks in the fall quarter, as this is the only quarter that they are ordered during the year.",

    "overview": "In the aftermath of the World War I, many artists and filmmakers asked new questions about the relationship between realism and religion. Could one reconcile concrete reality (or realism) with faith in the other-worldly? Many of the artists under discussion in the course drew upon themes that had already been raised by Kierkegaard in the 19th century. What was the relationship between religion and modernity, faith and ethics, reality and the supernatural, observable phenomena and invisible causes? How did one make sense of death in a meaningless universe? Was the universe meaningless? Could meaning be found in realism itself? Through engagement with films by directors ranging from Robert Bresson, Luis BunÌuel, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Ingmar Bergman, to Woody Allen and Harold Ramis, we will study mid-to-late 20th century films whose common theme is the quest to understand the meaning of life, either actively through taking up religious life, or because the protagonists consider themselves inhabiting a godless and meaningless universe. Class will be discussion-based, with a few short lectures to set up pertinent themes. Class readings will include Kierkegaard, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, among others. *Registration By Instructor Permission Only.",

We will focus on the political experiences of America's three largest groups of Latino-origin: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans.\n \nThe first part of the course will examine the social construction of Latino identities and trace the historical experiences of all three groups, comparing the elements behind each group's migration and how those processes affect their incorporation in mainstream society. We also examine demographic resources and the impact of immigration on the politics of the Latino collective. Next, we turn to the development of a Latino politics, placing special emphasis on public opinion, mobilization strategies, coalition politics and electoral participation. Lastly, we tackle public policy issues such as voting rights and immigration.\n \nThe question that we will return to throughout the course is the degree to which and under what circumstances it is appropriate to speak of a Latino voting block.",

    "overview": "Title: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics\n\nCourse Description: Of the various behaviors human beings engage in, doing mathematics is one of the strangest. With only a pencil and paper, we can predict when a falling object will land, compute the likelihood of a royal flush in poker, and discover facts like the Pythagorean Theorem that never become outdated. We talk about objects like \"numbers\" and \"functions\" that cannot be seen, heard, or felt, and yet are essential to our understanding of the natural world. The concept of infinity becomes, rather than an object of mystical wonderment, a tool for doing calculus.\n\nHow is any of this possible? In this course, we will discuss the relationship between mathematics, knowledge, and nature. We will ask questions like \"What is a number, really?\" and \"Can we know infinitely many things?\" We will read a wide variety of texts, from Plato's \"Meno\" to Wigner's \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.\" These topics will be the whetstone on which we hone our skills of technical writing, persuasive writing, and even creative writing.\n\nIt is not necessary to have any background in college-level mathematics in order to engage with these topics; this course has no math courses as prerequisites. If anything I have discussed here animates your curiosity, I would be delighted to see you in this course!",

    "overview": "Constructing Ancestry in the Middle East\n  \nThe question of ancestral ties and roots is at the root of some of the most pressing dynamics in the Middle East today. But what exactly does \"ancestry\" mean? What do people mean when they talk about \"roots\"âof a nation, of humankind, an ethnoreligious group, a \"race,\" or of individuals? How do people prove or enact ancestry, whether through blood, language, cultural affinity, or other tacit knowledges? What political claims do people make related to their genetic and cultural descent? This course examines these questions by looking into historical, social, and legal processes in which ancestries are curated. Through an interdisciplinary lens, we will study diverse ways in which people in the Middle East have understood the question of origins and ancestry, and we will analyze ideologies and values attributed to heredity. We will read ethnographies, historical accounts, philosophical texts, mythologies, and fiction to have a better grasp of the kinds of claims that frame ancestry as a foundation of, and a prop for broader entitlements. Special attention will be given to religious, ethnoracial, spatial, socioeconomic, and gendered understandings of ancestry.",

    "overview": "Studying emotions through literature allows us to reconsider not only the history of emotions but also the broader course of literary history in new ways. In this course, we will explore how Italian literature from the Middle Ages to the 20th century represents emotions like grief, joy, love, fear, and anger. Emotions, as portrayed in literature, reflect specific historical and cultural contexts, but also transcend time, challenging present-day understanding and inviting alternate forms of cognition and emotional experience.\nThrough a combination of close reading, historical analysis, and creative projects, students will delve into the complex relationship between emotion, literary form, and historical context. We will explore canonical works by Dante, Leopardi, Montale, and others, while also considering how these emotions resonate with modern audiences throughout the study of films, songs and opera. The course will combine lectures, interactive discussions, and individual presentations, culminating in both analytical and creative responses.",

    "overview": "Many define the Hebrew Bible as the best literature ever written. Indeed, the Hebrew Bible inspired numerous canonical novels and poems, not to mention paintings and sculptures, in Western culture. In the case of Hebrew literature, the connection to the Hebrew Bible is even more binding, as the biblical texts informed and inspired Zionist ideology and the revival of Hebrew as a modern language. In this class we will read a selection of biblical stories in their original language, biblical Hebrew, a reading which will enable us to see the immense influence of biblical Hebrew on Modern Hebrew language. We will then read Contemporary Hebrew poems that are based on the stories we have read. We will analyze both the biblical stories, the Hebrew poems, and the connections between them. The poems we will read in class are interpretations of the biblical stories; both the biblical texts and the modern poems are in Hebrew, but beyond the grammatical and periodical difference between the texts and the poems (Biblical Hebrew vs. Modern Hebrew), the poems can be political, ideological, social, or personal critique of or sometimes a dialogue with the biblical story. \nAll course materials will be in Hebrew, as well as class discussions. \nThis class is intended for students who are either heritage speakers of Hebrew or are in a very advanced level of Hebrew. The class level is equal to Hebrew fourth year. For questions about the class, please contact Prof. Hanna Tzuker Seltzer hanna.seltzer@northwestern.edu",

    "overview": "Oftentimes we hear of research done on communities. What we hear less about is the power inequities, silences, and sometimes, violence, that many research paradigms (un)intentionally produce within their research. This course exposes prevalent assumptions underlying common research methodologies and demonstrates why they are problematic for many of the communities that researchers purport to want to assist. We then delve into community-based participatory research (CBPR), a research paradigm that challenges researchers to conduct research with communities. In this reading-intense discussion-based course, we will learn the historical and theoretical foundations, and the key principles of CBPR. Students will be introduced to methodological approaches to building community partnerships, research planning, and data sharing. Real-world applications of CBPR in health will be studied to illustrate benefits and challenges of this methodological approach to research. Further, this course will address culturally appropriate interventions, working with diverse communities, and ethical considerations in CBPR.",

We will learn about variants of CBT (e.g., mindfulness, DBT, ACT), as well as the way that CBT is applied to different types of psychological problems or disorders. Class will consist of a combination of lecture and discussion, including frequent case examples. We may have a guest lecture from another practicing psychologist, and you will definitely learn to consider real applications from the field. You will also read research about CBT and will develop a research proposal for a study or conduct a literature review on a CBT-related topic of your choice.",

This course considers Indigenous and Native American notions of sovereignty that imagine nationhood outside of the nation-state framework. It reads these theorizations of sovereignty and nationhood alongside Latin American and Latinx anti-imperial writing. We will consider JosÃ© MartÃ­'s late nineteenth-century articulation of \"Our America\" alongside the rise of the Guna word \"Abiayala\" and its use by Indigenous activists from Latin America, and \"Turtle Island\" as the name that Native American creation stories give to our continent. Our discussions will trace connections between the storytelling traditions of Native American, Indigenous, and Latinx authors across the hemisphere. We will study the narrative forms that authors take up as they construct or critique nationhood: essays, short stories, novels and poetry. We will also examine how authors break down these forms by taking up communal authorship, orality, visual media, and multilingualism as narrative strategies that provide aesthetic and ideological challenges to canonical articulation of nation-state sovereignties.",

    "overview": "Languages across the globe vary in how they classify experience. Do these variations in linguistic classification affect the way people think? The Whorfian hypothesis -that the language we speak fundamentally influences how we think--was put forth in the 1960s, and has been a controversial topic ever since. In the last few decades, there has been new evidence from cross-linguistic studies and sophisticated laboratory studies that has sharpened the discussion. In this class we will consider the evidence both for and against the idea that language influences cognition and discuss different ways in which language interacts with cognition. We will read papers that show that different languages have different ways of talking about the wordâeven for basic topics such as space, time, number, and causation. This brings up several questions: Do these differences in language influence people's thinking? Does this happen even when we are not using language? Does learning language influence children's cognitive development?",

On the one hand, the course uses economics to understand the family, such as who marries whom, and how many children (if any) people choose to have. On the other hand, the course also considers the wider implications for family decisions for the economy at large, such as the repercussions of assortative mating in marriage for inequality in a society, and the relevance of family decisions for long-run economic development.",

    "overview": "This course provides an introduction to racial and ethnic politics in the United States. We begin by studying the concept and construction of race, focusing on evolving racial discourse from the late twentieth-century to present-day and paradigms of racial hierarchy that move beyond the black-white binary. We then examine the promises and pitfalls of forming panethnic racial categories/classifications, racial(ized) group identities, and racial group interests. Next, we turn our attention to political participation and mobilization with a focus on race-based political activism, studying examples of contemporary race and protest in the U.S. (e.g., Black Lives Matter, Stop Asian Hate, White Power). Lastly, we explore the politics of race and representation in popular culture (e.g., music, film/television) and in electoral politics (e.g., candidates and campaigns in the 2024 Election) to further illuminate how race critically shapes democratic processes and outcomes. Throughout the course we attend to the intersections of race with other identities such as ethnic/national origin, nativity, citizenship status, legal status, class, age, gender, sexuality, and religion.",

The topics we will cover include psychological research methods; the biology of behavior and emotion; perception; memory; thinking and problem solving; emotion; social influences on behavior; personality; and psychological disorders. A combination of class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of psychological science. Overall, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of an online laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have firstÂ¬hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

    "overview": "\"Money, Power, and Society\"\n\nWhat is money? How is the US dollar different from other forms of money in the past or present? Can the government simply print as much money as it needs to do what it wants? In this seminar, we will explore the nature and history of money from antiquity to cryptocurrency. Because our intuitions about money often rest on many myths and false assumptions, the history of money is usually shocking and fascinating even to people familiar with basic economic sociology. Furthermore, careful study of money helps us shine new light on big questions about politics, inequality, and government which will be of immense practical interest to students.\n\nCourse material will be interdisciplinary and students of all backgrounds are welcome. Each week readings will be divided between a new theoretical perspective on the first meeting, and a new empirical case on the second meeting. The empirical material will embrace the spirit of comparative historical research in sociology by introducing students to a wide range of cases including money in colonial America, Reconstruction, renaissance Florence, ancient Rome, cryptocurrency, and Sub-Saharan Africa. These cases will be carefully paired with new perspectives on money that will allow us to interrogate both the case and the theory in a structured, easy-to-follow way.",

    "overview": "In this course, we will view non-fiction and hybrid films that revolve around crime, criminal justice, and criminal court cases. We will emphasize cases that are either mired in controversy or emblematic of wider social concerns. Readings will augment viewings as we weigh legal, philosophical, or scientific perspectives: What is accurately depicted? What is omitted? What is misrepresented? Concurrently, we will investigate the films aesthetically: How is the film structured and why? What choices are the filmmaker making regarding camera, sound, and editing, and how do these choices affect viewers? Throughout the course, we will consider the ethics of depicting real people and traumatic events. We will also look at specific films in regard to their legal or societal impact.\n\nAssignments will include a series of short response papers and a substantial final project, which can take the form of either (up to the student) a ten to twelve-page paper or a six to twelve-minute film/podcast/media project. Projects should center on a legal topic. Ideas include but are not limited to, a paper that compares two films depicting the same criminal case or a polished/edited film interview with an individual connected to a crime or involved with the legal system (a defendant, a lawyer, a judge, a policeperson, etc.). Additional topics could center around mitigation films, viral crime videos, local courts, legal advocacy centers, or hybrid crime films.\n\nGrades will be determined according to 50% Showing Up and 50% clarity of vision/ability to communicate that vision.\n\nFor our class, Showing Up will entail the following:\n\n1.            On-time completion of work\n\n2.            Fulfilling the assignment per the parameters described in the syllabus\n\n3.            Listening and mindfully responding to feedback if applicable\n\n4.            Providing considerate critique to your classmates if applicable\n\n5.            Not doing outside work on your computer or your phone\n\n\nFor our class, clarity of vision/ability to communicate that vision will entail the following:\n\n1.            Conceptualizing and comprehensively articulating your ideas via writing, talking, or media, depending on the assignment.\n\n\nAssignments must be turned in on time for full credit.",

Students will significantly increase their knowledge of Italy's history and culture and they will be guided to become independent learners. After the completion of the entire sequence of Italian 102, students will be eligible to study in Italy and will be ready to embark on the minor or major in Italian.

    "overview": "This course explores the diverse landscape of queer and trans Latine culture through visual art, aesthetics, archival practices, and sound. We recognize that Latinx sexualities are complex and that the racialization of marginalized communities shapes cultural expressions. Through a diverse array of visual artworks, performances, sounds, and aesthetics, students will investigate how queer and trans-Latine artists articulate experiences, resistance, and politics of refusal. The course will delve into the historical and contemporary contexts of these expressions, emphasizing the importance of archiving and preserving queer and trans narratives within the Latino community. Our discussions, activities, and projects will be guided by intersectional traditions of Black feminist scholarship, woman of color feminism, and queer and trans of color critique.\nStudents will engage with critical scholarship in Latinx queer and trans studies to deepen their understanding of how race, class, sexuality, and gender affect current political contexts. This course invites all students to explore the rich aesthetic dimensions of queer and trans Latine culture, encouraging critical engagement and creative expression.",

This class will elaborate the iterative conception of sets, its relationship to the standard ZFC axioms, and will develop the theory of infinite ordinals and cardinals with the goal of establishing classical independence results.\n\nContact Prof. S.

    "overview": "Systems biology is not any single field in biology but rather, it is an approach to studying all of the life sciences. Systems biology is different from classical approaches such as reductionism, and it can tackle problems that cannot be solved by these other approaches. It uses quantitative measurement of individuals, whether organisms, cells, or molecules, and describes their collective behavior - how they act and function as groups or populations in living systems. It combines analysis of big data with simple mathematical modeling to capture the essence of collective behaviors. Systems biology is a gateway to synthetic biology, which engineers novel living systems based on collective behaviors. This course will focus on systems approaches to study important phenomena in molecular and cell biology, and developmental biology. Emphasis on modeling, analysis of big data, and interpretation of results will be given in the course.",

As their electoral clout continues to grow, as evidenced by recent elections, Latinos/as will have the opportunity to exert greater influence in the politics and policies of our country.\n\nThis course will explore these implications and the histories, including the more contemporary social and political developments of Latino communities, in the United States from a comparative framework. We will focus on the political experiences of America's three largest groups of Latino-origin: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans.\n\nThe first part of the course will examine the social construction of Latino identities and trace the historical experiences of all three groups, comparing the elements behind each group's migration and how those processes affect their incorporation in mainstream society. We also examine demographic resources and the impact of immigration on the politics of the Latino collective. Next, we turn to the development of a Latino politics, placing special emphasis on political attitudes, mobilization strategies and electoral participation. Lastly, we tackle public policy issues such as voting rights and language policy.\n\nThe question that we will return to throughout the course is the degree to which and under what circumstances it is appropriate to speak of a Latino community.",

We will ask what kinds of people were able to practice medicine (priests? physicians? nuns? magicians?), why a person's barber was also their surgeon, how the dead supported the health of the living, and why rituals like confession could treat stomach aches and other ailments. \n\nWe will learn what a vial of urine could tell a medieval physician about a patient's habits, consider how an individual's astrological sign influenced their treatment plan, and discuss what an excess of garlic in a person's diet might tell us about the moral state of their spirit. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify and analyze the complex, nuanced systems that medieval people used to theorize the body and its relationship to the soul, and will be able to articulate how physical, spiritual, and even supernatural medicines were often combined to treat both. \n\nAs we study the nuances of premodern medicine, we will also work to rethink the relationship between religion and science in our own world, and consider whether and where our modern healthcare practices align with the past as much as they depart from it.\n\nCounts toward Religion, Health, and Medicine (RHM) major concentration.",

    "overview": "The Holocaust and its Memory in Israel\n\nThis course examines the origins, development, course, and consequences of the most comprehensive genocide in history and the ways it has been remembered by Israeli society. The first part of the course will focus on the persecution of Jews during the first half of the 20th century culminating in their genocide between 1939-1945. We will discuss Nazi ideology; the complex interface between the Nazi regime's espousal of racism and the motivation of perpetrators on the ground; the interface between politics and law; the victims' reactions to persecution; conditions of life in the ghettos and camps; the response of the international community; and the aftermath of the war. In the second part of the course, we will examine Israeli society's different and even contradicting attitudes toward the Holocaust. We will probe how the establishment of the State of Israel, the 1950s mass immigration, and the evolving Arab-Israeli conflict shaped Israelis' understanding and memory of the Holocaust. We will analyze various primary documents and watch videos throughout the course.",

    "overview": "Love Scripts: from Sappho to Taylor Swift\n\nRomantic love, although a personal and intimate experience, unfolds amid social norms that guide or regulate many of its aspects, from the identification of a desirable partner to expectations about the outcome of the relationship. The \"scripts\" to be studied in this course refer both to the material traces of love songs transmitted from antiquity to the present on papyri, calf skin, or medieval manuscripts, and to the social protocols implied in and through those texts. As we read poems originating from ancient Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Romeâincluding homoerotic poems sung at drinking parties and sophisticated love elegies addressed to mysterious and probably fictional addresseesâwe will draw on the resources of literary analysis to explore the narratives and poetic images through which love has been reimagined over time; we will historicize social constructions of the interplay of love, sex, and reproduction; and we will analyze the rhetorical construction of erotic bodies and partners' roles.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs. This course is the second in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will be asynchronous.",

    "overview": "ME 373 is the second course in fluid mechanics for undergraduates. ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. \n\nThis course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.\n\nIn ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of \"synthesis\" by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow â the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of \"analysis\" to unravel the physical content of these equations. In the process, we learn about a variety of fluid phenomena and its applications such as: supersonic flow and the principles of design of jet engines, viscous boundary layers and the consequent drag on airplane wings, the concept of vorticity and how it describes phenomena such as tornadoes etc.\n\nTopics Include:\n\nâ¢ Steady viscous flows (exact solutions)\n           Poiseuille flow in round pipes\n           Couette flow between parallel plates\nâ¢ Inviscid flows \n           concept of vorticity and the generalized Bernoulli theorem\n           irrotational (or potential) flows - the velocity potential and the stream function\nâ¢ Compressible layers \n           one dimensional isentropic flows - the Laval nozzle\n           Shocks\nâ¢ Boundary layers \n           Prandtl's boundary layer theory for \"almost\" inviscid flows",

    "overview": "This course develops several simple models for thinking about the determinants of variables like aggregate employment, unemployment, investment, consumption, interest rates, inflation, exchange rates and the balance of trade. The framework is used to address issues such as: what is the role of saving in determining the long run wealth of the country; what is the role of money in accounting for inflation; what are the factors accounting for the recurrent fluctuations in employment and output called the business cycle; what factors account for fluctuations in the US dollar; what risks, if any, do the high US government deficits and large U.S. international deficits pose for the health of the US economy? Particular attention in Winter 2025 will be given to the causes of and solutions to the U. S. financial market meltdown of 2008-09, the causes of the slow recovery since 2009, and especially the effects of the 2020-22 pandemic on output, employment, and especially the inflation that was such a big issue in the 2024 election.",

    "overview": "Topic: Body Building\n\nIn Pumping Iron, a young Arnold Schwarzenegger describes his body as a living artwork: \"good bodybuilders have the same mind in terms of sculpting that a sculptor has. You look in the mirror and say, âOkay, I need a little more deltoid to get the proportion right.' So you exercise and put those deltoids on, whereas an artist would just slap on some clay.\" In an age of Instagram Face and mail-order Ozempic, it's not unusual to think of our physical form as fundamentally malleable. But what are the stakes of understanding our bodies to be constructed and changeable objects? Should we celebrate what philosopher Paul Preciado calls \"bioempowerment,\" using our bodies to derail familiar gender norms? Does embracing bodily flexibility align us uncomfortably with an economy that demands ever more energy, availability, and agility from its workers? And where do the bodily norms against which we sculpt ourselves come from, anyway? Roving from the Renaissance anatomy theater to drive-through plastic surgery clinics, this course will explore some of the discourses, political structures, and material practices that shape our bodies, both physically and figuratively. Alongside theoretical texts, such as writing by Michel Foucault and Judith Butler, we will look at poems that dissect the bodies of their beloved, fiction by authors ranging from Mary Shelley to Jamil Jan Kochai, journalistic investigations into fatphobia, and films, dances, and visual artworks that use prosthesis and collage to rearrange familiar forms. In doing so, you will get the chance to think through how these texts are constructed, and investigate the ways that literary, visual, and physical forms influence one another. You will also practice examining and developing the mechanics of your own writing, gaining facility in posing effective questions, amassing and wielding evidence, constructing compelling arguments, and crafting your writerly voice with greater clarity.",

    "overview": "This seminar approaches global health topics from a political science perspective. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, global health security, global health governance, and global health diplomacy have emerged as key issues in understanding geopolitics. How do power dynamics shape the global health landscape? Who are the various actors (state and non-state; public and private) involved in global health decisions and how do they wield power to shape policy? How do these tactics combat or reinforce health disparities? What factors make collective action and cooperation around global health issues more likely? Throughout the course we investigate how state and local governments are influenced through top-down approaches from international institutions and bottom-up approaches from grass-roots organizations. In addition to a focus on understanding how actors and processes engage in agenda setting and influence policymaking, we will discuss how enacted policies and political events impact health services delivery and population health. Students will explore these dynamics through case studies such as vaccination campaigns, abortion access, noncommunicable disease management, HIV/AIDS, TB, and climate-driven health crises, among others. Ultimately, we examine the ways in which states navigate the tension between sovereignty and cooperation when striving for global health security in an increasingly inter-connected world.",

    "overview": "Romantic love, although a personal and intimate experience, unfolds amid social norms that guide or regulate many of its aspects, from the identification of a desirable partner to expectations about the outcome of the relationship. The \"scripts\" to be studied in this course refer both to the material traces of love songs transmitted from antiquity to the present on papyri, calf skin, or medieval manuscripts, and to the social protocols implied in and through those texts. As we read poems originating from ancient Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Romeâincluding homoerotic poems sung at drinking parties and sophisticated love elegies addressed to mysterious and probably fictional addresseesâwe will draw on the resources of literary analysis to explore the narratives and poetic images through which love has been reimagined over time; we will historicize social constructions of the interplay of love, sex, and reproduction; and we will analyze the rhetorical construction of erotic bodies and partners' roles.",

The theme of the course points to a strategy of writing where the \"eye of the other\" is mobilized either to critique society and/or to capture relations of power and domination. We will ask questions such as how the perspective of the other drives the story line, what it enables the author and the story to do, and what are the political and historical implications of this \"eye of the other\" at the different junctures in time: the enlightenment, the age of exploration and colonization, the colonial period, and the postcolonial. \n\nIn addition to the historical arc, we will also focus on the different genres of the novel, namely the philosophical, the epistolary, the romantic, and the colonial and the postcolonial to understand the specificity of their forms in relation to the questions of of our course.  Students will be periodically provided critical essays to become familiar with scholarship on the works and the genres we read. They will also be asked to present critical essays to the class. This assignment enables students to practice researching and determining the relevance of the scholarship for the context of the class while enhancing their French language abilities. The written essays and the presentations together will hone student skills in written and oral French at the academic level.",

We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

    "overview": "This course is the second in a three-quarter sequence of graduate probability theory with an eye towards statistical inference. The first course covers an introduction to mathematical probability theory including measure theory, law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem. In this course, after a brief review of the aforementioned topics, we cover Markov chains, conditional expectation, martingales, Poisson processes, and selected advanced topics, together with statistical applications. \n\nA brief outline of topics covered is as follows: \n\nLectures 1 - 2: Introduction and overview. Review of measure theory, concentration inequalities, law of large numbers, central limit theorem. \n\nLectures 3 - 7: Markov chains: introduction, stationary distribution, convergence, ergodic theorem, recurrence and transience. Statistical applications. \n\nLectures 8 - 9: Conditional expectation. \n\nLecture 10: Midterm exam. \n\nLectures 11 - 14: Martingales: introduction, stopping times, optional stopping theorem, applications, martingale convergence, and more. Statistical applications. \n\nLectures 15 - 16: Poisson processes: introduction, superposition, thinning. Continuous time Markov chains. Statistical applications. \n\nLectures 17 - 18: Selected topics, time and interest permitting, which may include: Brownian motion, heavy tails, extreme value theory, Markov chain mixing times, large deviations, concentration of measure, random matrices, and more, with statistical applications. \n\nWeek 10: Review and final exam.",

    "overview": "Crisis, Contentious Politics, and Critical Thought in Latin America\n\nThe course starts with a critique of theories that, in the second half of the 20th century, argued for the impossibility of a democratic matrix of modernity in Latin America. Instead, it seeks to highlight how the continent served as a laboratory in which, during various cycles of global crisis, attempts were made to consolidate a democratic path, specifically one that addressed popular sovereignty as the expansion of the political sphere, redistribution, and cultural representation. \n\nThe course explores cycles of capitalism that have put different social classes under tension, the politicization of these differences, the formation of power dynamics, the configuration of state institutions and the shared repertoires between state agencies and social subjects. In connection, the course addresses the contest over the interpretation of social tensions as shaped by ideology, culture, and aesthetic representation. The debates accompanying the periods to be addressed include: the Spanish American Enlightenment, imperialism, and democratic republicanism (Black and popular); racial positivism and revolutionary modernism; gamonal and falangist thought versus national-popular thought and the strategy of popular fronts in Latin America; avant-gardes in the context of the struggle for hegemony; the Cold War, the origins of postmodernism; dependency theories and the Marxist school of modes of production theory in Latin America. The debate over the origins of the welfare state or pre-emptive state in Latin America, the problem of the national-popular in the face of the 20th-century crisis will also be addressed. The course will end with a discussion of Ideologies and violence surrounding authoritarian neoliberalism and the problem of hegemony in the present. This course combines social history of politics and political languages, critical studies on culture and hegemony, and historical and comparative sociology from Latin America.",

    "overview": "If you've watched Saltburn or the Netflix series Bridgerton, you know that the English estate has undergone some cultural revision. No longer the opulent backdrop of period drama, the country house is the site of reckonings with the history of England's overseas empire, traffic in captive people, and flagrantly unequal distribution of wealth and power. In this class, we will trace the ongoing force of English literary refigurations of landed property initially tied to the largesse and power of the lord of the manor. We'll first explore the early modern country house poem, where the landed estate serves as a locus of pastoral abundance and naturalized social, architectural, and ecological order. But as we will discover, cracks appear in this vision. Moving forward, we encounter the idealized country house contested from the vantage of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century novels whose narrators and protagonists include servants, colonial subjects, and witnesses to family decadence financed by slavery. We'll turn to twentieth-century texts that claim the decaying country house as source of ghostly national nostalgia. Our final unit will engage public revision (in print, monuments, and activism) of the estate as \"English Heritage.\" We will watch at least one episode of Bridgerton (Season 1, 2020) and the film Saltburn (2023) to assess recent popular re-representations of the landed estate.",

In 1900, 1-in-5 people died before age 5; by 1980, that number was less than 1-in-50. How did these changes occur? How do we measure them? How did these changes affect US society? In this course, we will examine the demographic history of the US from after the Civil War to the mid 20th century. Students will learn core demographic concepts and measures, like fertility and mortality rates. They will explore the demographic patterns and changes in the United States. They will examine leading theories for fertility and mortality decline and explore the role of immigration in US history. Students will learn to analyze publicly available census microdata from IPUMS, culminating in an independent research project.",

We will thenâ¯work our way through texts produced in colonial and postcolonial settings in the Middle East and North Africa.

We will begin by watching Poland's earliest talkies and films of the interwar period before discussing the Holocaust and Stalinism and its \"thaw\" on film during the communist era. From there, we will discuss the Polish Film School and the Cinema of Morality Anxiety. Further, we will analyze themes of absurdism and the subversive, and later examine the changing forms, subjects, and elements of films in post-1989 Poland. We will watch films by such directors as Juliusz Gardan, StanisÅaw Bareja, Andrzej Wajda, Wanda Jakubowska, Aleksander Ford, Krzysztof KieÅlowski, and PaweÅ Pawlikowski.

    "overview": "The topic of exileâthe forced abandonment of the place and world one calls homeâcaptured the imagination of peoples across the ancient Mediterranean. The Greek [Odyssey] and Roman [Aeneid], famous accounts of the predicaments of classical exile, were by no means isolated instances. These renowned poems were in conversation with narratives that circulated widely among neighboring Egyptian, Hebrew, Babylonian, Phoenician, and other ancient communities, in stories which not only produced echoes among themselves, but very likely borrowed from each other. In this seminar, we will read and discuss representative accounts of exile from the ancient Mediterranean world, highlighting their historical and geographical specificity but also reflecting on their treatment of common concerns and themesâsuch as homelessness and hospitality, longing and belonging, identity and otherness, hosts and guests, refugees and havens, pain and nostalgia, presence and absence, etc. While the seminar will highlight the historical and archaeological coordinates of those narratives, we will also reflect upon their relevance in discussing the very current reality of exilic life in today's world.\n\nAs a first-year seminar, this course is meant to hone your abilities in the practice of academic writing. The activities for the seminar address this goal by implementing peer-review processes and exploring different writing techniques and sequences.",

    "overview": "AY 24 -25 Beginning with the Choson Dynasty's integration into the modern nation-state world system in the 19th century, this course equips students with critical frameworks to explore modern Korean culture and art. The examination includes the scrutiny of discursive constructions of national subjectivity and the resulting political, social, and cultural realities. In this context, the term 'culture' in the course title is broadly defined, encompassing not only works of art but also systems of thought and social practices developed throughout the history of modern Korea.\n\nThe course will delve into fundamental questions such as: What is Korean literature, and what defines national cinema? What roles do literature, film, and art play in the construction of national subjectivity and consciousness? How have Korean writers and artists navigated the complex and ongoing process of identity construction amid the tumultuous history of colonialism, national division, diasporic displacement, and authoritarian rule? Additionally, how is the supposedly autonomous institution of art, such as the theorization and understanding of modern literature (munhak), inseparably linked to the historical adaptation of modernity? While challenging presumptions of a nation or national culture with an unchanging or seemingly 'natural' essence, the course is designed to provide students with critical techniques for exploring Korean art and culture against the backdrop of modern history.",

The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

    "overview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\nThe instructor of \"Lessons in Non-Profit Management\" is: Sol Anderson\nThis course is jointly sponsored by Business Institutions and a student organization called campusCatalyst.  The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 15 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

Through media texts and experiential learning, we consider Asian American foodways as a space to examine multiplicity, authenticity, and hybridity. We place Asian American food in the local context, through exploration of Chicagoland space and place-making. There will be at least two mandatory off-campus trips.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs. This course is the second in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will be asynchronous.",

    "overview": "The fragility of the human body, its susceptibility to illness and death, provoked a wide array of responses among religious practitioners in pre-modern China. Some pursued supernatural longevity and even immortality through various regimes of self-cultivation. Others, by contrast, renounced the body in part or whole through dramatic acts of self-immolation. Even in death, however, many aspired to rebirth in heavenly realms where bodies do not grow old and die, but rather live forever in bliss. This course examines these various attempts to overcome death in Chinese religionâincluding Buddhism, Daoism, and traditions that fall between these large categoriesâseeking to understand how the mortality of the body was used to authorize particular modes of embodied living. In the process, we will explore how these modes of religious life shaped attitudes toward food, medicine, gender, sexuality, and family.\n\nCounts towards Religion, Health and Medicine (RHM) and Religion, Sexuality and Gender (RSG) major concentrations.",

This course is an introduction to the concepts of paleobiology: the nature of fossils, evolutionary trends and adaptations, systematics, paleoecology, and biogeography.  We will investigate how life, from individual organisms to whole biomes, has changed over time; the geologic processes that lead to the burial and preservation of organic material; and the scientific methods by which we infer the biological processes that occurred across deep time from the limited and often biased fossil record.

These literary works powerfully dramatize the many ways in which we experience animals: as companions and as sources of food, in zoos and in nature, as objects of scientific study and as reflections of ourselves. The readings will offer us the opportunity to reflect on such questions as: Is it possible to know what an animal is thinking and feeling? Why are our pets so important to us? Are we justified in using animals for food and in laboratory experiments? Through class discussion and varied writing assignments, you'll articulate your answers to those and other questions to your colleagues in the seminar.",

This course will explore these questions in relation to the original rabbis of late antiquity (3rd-7th centuries CE) through narratives, myths, and ethnographic accounts about rabbinic sex, gender and sexuality in the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds. You will learn to expand the definition of what constitutes \"sex\" or \"desire,\" \"kinship\" or \"connection,\" \"body\" or \"text,\" by examining ancient rabbinic forms of gendered, textual, and bodily transmission. Students will learn to become curious about bodily norms that are quite removed from the worlds that we inhabit no matter one's starting point, and will learn to make connections across the ancient and contemporary. \n\nThis is a deep-reading, discussion-based course that will provide students with an opportunity to learn how to read rabbinic texts in translation, to generate conversational learning through Jewish textual practices like question-and-response, and partnered study, also known as hevruta, and to deepen your knowledge of contemporary theory in gender/sex and sexuality. We will focus our attention continuously and deeply on a few key rabbinic texts, taking our time to plumb their many layers and the dynamic quality of rabbinic interpretive possibilities.

    "overview": "The situation of writing requires that we create literature, as well as the contexts in which literature is shared, appreciated and understood. We are the inheritors, perpetuators and innovators of literary culture, and in this class, we will position our inquiries on the present and future, even as we acknowledge the enduring humanistic values of creative writing. We will begin with a discussion of ideas about shaping the literary traditions of the United States starting with Melville, and moving quickly to those who have led or lead in shaping that tradition by shaping it or walking away from itâRoxane Gay, Adrienne Rich, Richard Baldwin, and others. Then we will build on these ideas practically with a service learning assignment and a creative work that reaches a new public, coordinates new media or engenders community. Our class will be enhanced by the annual Return Engagement series, featuring visits and readings from alumni of Northwestern's Writing Program. My intention is to have a conversation that will unfold in real-time between us all, and will evolve into a learning experience that is both pragmatically useful and philosophically illuminating. My hope is that this class will help us to become more conscious of our motives and processes as writers; that it will allow us to more lucidly defend creative writing as an art form and a vital contribution to society; and that it will acquaint us with the productions of literary culture, including their changing technological platforms and their relationship to social structures. This course is part of the Hewlett Diversity Initiative, and as part of this program, we will investigate literature and culture through the lens of social inequalities and diversities.",

Instead, we will be focusing on how archaeologists think about key environmental concepts, including climate change, sustainability, and resilience. We will discuss examples of \"failure\" and \"success\" in the long history of human-environment interactions, and see if there's room for nuance along the way. We will also use this course as an opportunity to consider how archaeology can contribute to current environmental sustainability and environmental justice efforts. Prior coursework in archaeology is not required to appreciate this class or do well, but would be helpful.",

We will thenâ¯work our way through texts produced in colonial and postcolonial settings in the Middle East and North Africa. Surveying over 150 years of detection, we will use these texts to understandâ¯the relationship between criminal investigation and literary interpretation, between history and the present, and between literary style and political authority.",

    "overview": "Environmental anthropology is a more recent outgrowth of ecological anthropology, which emerged in the 1960s and 70s as a quantitative focus on systemic human-environment relationships, especially as they pertain to patterns of social change and adaptation. Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s, and is typically characterized by qualitative research on communities' engagements with contemporary environmental issues. Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we'll see in this course, the proliferation of \"new ecologies\" (as opposed to \"new environmentalisms\") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies.\n\nThis course is divided into two parts. Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology. We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, ecofeminisms, and interspecies studies. Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology knowledge to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalist consumption, biodiversity conservation, sustainable land use, climate change, and environmental justice.",

We will learn about, put to use, and practice a wide range of data science methods that are commonly used in these fields.  The class is designed to be a hands-on learning experience using the open source programming language, R. No experience in R is required (but having some experience can be helpful). We will begin with data manipulation and wrangling, and then move on to common quantitative analyses, their variations, and how best to visualize data. By the end of the class, students will have the skills and confidence to address a wide variety of questions with quantitative methods.",

We will continue to use INTERMATIK as our core grammar online resource, discuss everyday culture of German-speaking countries, and read an excerpt from a play by Bertolt Brecht to continue our exploration of modern German literature. In the fall quarter we read a 19th century romantic story, in the winter we will discuss 20th century Germany, and in the spring, a contemporary piece from the 21st century awaits. The primary goal is to develop proficiency in all German language skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing). Class activities will be communicative and, in the winter and spring quarters you will have a chance to converse individually with German native speakers online. No purchase necessary; all materials are sponsored by the German department.",

    "overview": "Scholars of language and writing argue that language and its varieties, genres, modes, and rhetorical strategies are always shifting, flexible, and contested. Thus, sociolinguistic diversityâdifferences across and within languages and dialectsâis inevitable. This seminar will explore how language difference is situated in current US and global discourses, considering language in written, spoken, and signed forms. We will disrupt monolingual ideologies that infiltrate those discourses, focusing on language diversity as an asset to individuals, cultures, and institutions. The course will consider college as one of those institutions and will explore language diversity and linguistic social justice as part of your first-year experience at Northwestern. Using scholarly readings from sociolinguistics and writing pedagogy along with popular non-fiction, the course will consider how we can sustain sociolinguistic diversity, how we can foster equity, access, and inclusion around language difference, and how our sociolinguistic diversity sustains us. You will formulate and explore your own questions about language diversity and linguistic justice in papers, presentations, and class discussions.",

Recent eco-fiction, however, challenges that familiar narrative, proposing ways that we humans may find ourselves transfigured along with the world around us. In this class we will engage with accounts of such human metamorphosis, considering the children's stories of Dr. Seuss, the hyper-empathy of Octavia Butler, the \"new weird\" landscapes of Jeff Vandermeer's Area X and a selection of other short works. Film viewings will include Pixar's 2008 Wall-E and other films (TBA). Course readings/viewing will include brief readings from literary criticism.  We will also consider practical topics such as how University library resources and experts can help students locate and evaluate key sources and develop authoritative arguments.  This course will use a traditional grading structure.  Content warning:  Some readings and viewings include references to sexual violence, self-harm, torture, and suicide.",

    "overview": "Disease, disordered function, and individual difference in the brain can have effects ranging from subtle to devastating. In this course, students will learn about common human brain conditions, their cellular and molecular causes, and treatments. We will cover a variety of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and atypical function. Students will synthesize this information to identify common mechanisms. We will discuss how the causes of brain disease are discovered and what we don't yet know. Ethical questions in neural medicine will also be addressed. Class format will usually consist of two one-hour lectures plus a weekly session consisting of student reading and discussion of primary research articles. Some classes will be \"flipped\" with pre-class lectures and reading and in-class activity replacing lecture. No textbook, all readings from the literature. A major goal is to develop the skills to read and critique current research in the field.",

    "overview": "Many writers rely on archives in the crafting of their own books. These archives may be private: family photo albums, school report cards, or baking recipes. Of course, the archives may be public: the correspondence of community organizers, the lab notes of scientists, or the recorded minutes of city council meetings. Whether private or public, archives can become the starting point for producing a creative text or they can serve to confirm memory or to bolster imagination; other times archives offer unexpected layers to a creative project. Why and when then do we turn to archives? How do we navigate the ethical questions raised by this work? How do we negotiate with the line between what has been recorded and what we want to imagine? How do we know when it's time to leave the archive or to stay longer?\n\nIn this course, we will be reading creative texts across genre that engage with archives usually in explicit ways including the novel Sound Museum: A Theory Fiction by poupeh missaghi, the memoir Liliana's Invincible Summer by Cristina Rivera Garza; and the poetry book and online project West: A Translation by Paisley Rekdal. We will take field trips to traditional archives and also engage with our existing private records. Course work will consist of short reflections on the readings, responding to writing prompts, and facilitating discussions.",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "Seminar for Majors course aims to provide a \"how-to\" of American Studies from an integrative, multiracial, and socio-cultural perspective. Taking U.S. American cultures as a site for testing classic and contemporary theories about how society works, this seminar in American Studies serves to introduce resources and techniques for interdisciplinary research. Students will be exposed to and experiment with a wide range of current theoretical and methodological approaches applied in American Studies and contributing disciplinary fields. The goal of the course is not only for students to develop knowledge of main currents in the field of American Studies but also to become practitioners through a series of assignments that will permit students to exercise their newfound skills. For instance, as students develop rhetorical analyses, describe and evaluate visual culture, or conduct and analyze interview data, they will also examine themes such as national narratives, civil rights and immigration, and the historical and social meanings of work, discipline, and justice.",

How did women of African descent in Europe (France, Belgium, Switzerland), the Caribbean (Haiti, Guadeloupe, Martinique), the Indian Ocean (La RÃ©union, Mayotte, and the Comoros) and Africa (Senegal, Mali, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo), whose cultures and political experiences were - at least partly - impacted by French and Belgium colonial legacy, forge their critiques of patriarchy, colonialism, and imperialism, racism? How did they also develop their own imagination of social justice, autonomy, and emancipation? \n\nBased on a wide range of materials and references driven by the social sciences, literature, and cinema, this course aims to introduce undergraduate students to a non-US-centered and transnational perspective on Black feminisms. The historical period will span from the early 20th century to the contemporary era. According to specific topics addressed in the class, comparative insights with the English-speaking Caribbean and Africa and women's experiences in the Global South will also be included in the conversation and materials.",

The final project is a short video about your case study.\n\nTo develop your research projects, the class foregrounds different methodological approaches: 1) To move beyond journalism, we will conduct primary and secondary historical research to understand the complex historical roots of each case study. 2) We will analyze and practice forms of ethnographic writing to better situate and describe the lived experiences of migration and exile, both past and present. 3) We will pay attention to various forms of media, whether print culture, sound, or visual media, to interrogate but also experiment with contemporary modes of narrating and conveying human experience in the digital age. Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring rigorous historical and ethnographic detail to visual storytelling.",

Law shapes our day-to-day lives incountless ways. This course examines the connections andrelationships of law and society using an interdisciplinary socialscience approach. As one of the founders of the Law and Societymovement observed, \"law is too important to leave to lawyers.\"Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical,disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology,history, anthropology, political science, and critical studies) in order toexplore the sociology of law and law's role primarily in the Americancontext. The thematic topics to be discussed include law and socialcontrol; law's role in social change; and law's capacity to reach intocomplex social relations and intervene in existing normativeinstitutions and organizational structures.  \n\nCross-listed with Sociology 206-0",

    "overview": "Civil Military Relations in Democratic Societies\n\nDemocracies around the world require a military to defend their people, values and interests from enemies abroad and within. They require a military to help advance the national interest abroad. However, they also need a military that will not seek to undermine the freedoms and will of the people that make democratic governance possible. In other words, the military must be subordinate to elected leaders and not seek to build a coup. Civil-Military Relations describes the connections that civilian policymakers have with their country's armed forces. It is the boundaries between diplomacy and war. Civilians and their elected leaders should focus on making foreign policy while the military should focus on how to best defend the state. When in good balance, proper relations sustain a democracy as the will of the people, reflected through their elected leaders, prevail. When in poor balance, military leaders can overtake the government in the form of a coup. In this course, we will think about the role of a military in a democratic government and how democracies use their militaries to advance their interests abroad. In addition, we will think about how civilian leaders and military officers ought to interact with one another to sustain a democracy.  Finally, students will apply the current theories and debates in civil-military relations to develop a research project of personal interest. By the end of the course, students will be able to contribute to discussions in the literature through asking and answering questions of their own. They will also be able to become critical consumers of academic literature and be able to communicate their findings to a general audience.",

    "overview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

The class will provide an introduction to the period of the German Empire or Kaiserreich 1871 - 1918. This epoch in German history is emblematic for modernism. Through short historical texts, biographies, letters and journals, students will learn about social issues, art movements and the German politics of the period that included Bismarck, artistic colonies and war. Students will become acquainted with the artworks of KÃ¤the Kollwitz, Paula Modersohn-Becker, Gabriele MÃ¼nter and more. Visits to the Art Institut, the Block Museum and the Milwaukee Art Museum are planned. Students will complete a project-based presentation and paper in lieu of a final exam.",

It has fascinated and puzzled scholars, politicians, and the broader public, creating the impression that everyone has an opinion about it. This course explores its roots, its major historical milestones, and the different narratives of the conflict, viewed from the perspective of Palestinians and Israelis. The approach of the course is historical, so emphasis will be placed on understanding the shifting historical local and international contexts in which the conflict has evolved, and the ways it has been interpreted and remembered by both Israelis and Palestinians. The course will combine not only academic writing but also literature, film, posters, and documentaries. Students will engage in historiographical debates as well as in the analyses of primary sources.",

    "overview": "This course explores the movement of future-oriented art practices across the overlapping geopolitical spaces of modernity, 1900-1968. We focus on five paradigms that sought to place art in the position of the vanguard of social and political change. We engage these movements and their use and claims of art and architecture as \"avant-garde\" forces against established conventions. We examine Futurism, Constructivism, Dada, Surrealism, and Socialist Realism, tracing their formations and transformations across multiple geographies, including the Soviet Union, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America, India, China, Japan, and elsewhere.\n\nWe will engage these practices first from a historical perspective, examining the broad spectrum of new and critical art that emerged in the twentieth century. Our historical lens will focus on the transnational movement and connectivity of people and ideas, taking into consideration how the global economy of an unequal distribution of resources contributed to these practices. Secondly, and interconnected to these historical and economic shifts, we will adopt a historiographic perspective, questioning how the avant-garde has been depicted and acclaimedâassessed for meaningâfor historians, artists, and collectives during various periods of transformation and resistance (and even revolution). Rather than drawing a strict division between the historical and so-called \"neo\" avant-garde movements, our aim is to recognize the continued exchanges and interplays between the avant-garde projects that preceded World War II and those that emerged after. This trans-temporal line of inquiry allows us to contemplate the continuation of avant-garde practices as artists navigated new contradictions and contexts in the ostensibly bipolar Cold War order.",

    "overview": "Special relativity is at the heart of our most foundational understanding of the universe.  The very nature of what particles can exist are entirely constrained by quantum mechanics and the representations of the Lorentz group.  How can special relativity which allows space and time to rotate into each other be consistent with the quantum mechanics of Bohr, Planck, Heisenberg, and Schrodinger which as we learn treats time on a very special footing? Our path to the answer of relativistic quantum field theory begins by understanding our first relativistic classical effective field theory: Classical Electrodynamics.  This course will introduce us to the modern language of Lorentz invariant field theory, highlighting universal principles.\n\nPart 1a: Foundations and Review (Special Relativity). Symmetry groups (2-D rotations, 3-D rotations, Lorentz transformations).  Special relativity and relativistic notation. Energy and momentum of a point particle.\n\nPart 1b:  Foundations and Review (E\u0026M):  Electromagnetism in one frame of reference.  Maxwell's equations, conservation laws and the Poynting vector, Scalar and vector potentials and their E\u0026M gauge transformations.\n\nPart 2: Relativistic electrodynamics. 4-vector current and potentials, the electromagnetic field tensor, Maxwell equations in relativistic form. Lorentz transformations and invariants of the current and fields. \nThe stress-energy tensor. The relativistic point particle.\n\nPart 3: Action principles. The electromagnetic field interacting with a point particle. Conservation laws from symmetry via Noether.\n\nPart 4: Solving the wave equations using Green's functions. The Green's function in relativistic form.  Relativistic particle moving in an arbitrary manner. The Lienard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nPart 6: Linear acceleration and synchrotron radiation.  Multipole expansion of radiation fields.\n\nPart 7: Advanced classical optics, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction, non-linear media.",

    "overview": "This seminar approaches global health topics from a political science perspective. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, global health security, global health governance, and global health diplomacy have emerged as key issues in understanding geopolitics. How do power dynamics shape the global health landscape? Who are the various actors (state and non-state; public and private) involved in global health decisions and how do they wield power to shape policy? How do these tactics combat or reinforce health disparities? What factors make collective action and cooperation around global health issues more likely? Throughout the course we investigate how state and local governments are inï¬uenced through top-down approaches from international institutions and bottom-up approaches from grass-roots organizations. In addition to a focus on understanding how actors and processes engage in agenda setting and inï¬uence policymaking, we will discuss how enacted policies and political events impact health services delivery and population health. Students will explore these dynamics through case studies such as vaccination campaigns, abortion access, noncommunicable disease management, HIV/AIDS, TB, and climate-driven health crises, among others. Ultimately, we examine the ways in which states navigate the tension between sovereignty and cooperation when striving for global health security in an increasingly inter-connected world.",

We will also look at the lives of children themselves and how individuals experience being children, kids, teens, and so forth in a particular time and place. In particular, we will examine how the experience of being a young person has varied by historical period, but also by social status, including race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status and generation. \n\nAs a class, we will also be very critical of cultural and media portrayals of children and teenagers and ask how these representations have reflected and shaped how society views youth. We will also look at how childhood itself has been connected to various social problems and social concerns both historically and today. \n\nThe final topic for the course will be how adolescents make the transition to adulthood socially, emotionally, and economically, and how this transition has changed over time - particularly over the last several decades.",

The class will cover these effects, their impact on Native American and non-Native communities, the maple syrup industry, and maple species themselves through articles and readings. Along with a focus on maple syrup production, we will cover aspects of food sovereignty happening across the United States, Canada, and other parts of the world. Examining how communities and countries are looking inward towards traditional economies and practices to adapt to a changing climate.  Through field observations of climatic and natural phenomena, students will work in groups to collect data from three maple species on campus. The groups will examine and record sugar ratios, sap flow rates, and ambient temperature and precipitation: along with a focus on species differentiation, soil nutrients, and campus micro-climates. The final product for the class would be a group data report. A copy of the report will go to facilities management to be added to their campus tree inventory.",

Questions to be discussed may include: Is self-awareness necessary or sufficient for selfhood? What guarantees the continuity of personal identity over time? To what degree is the self constituted by its social context? Are there good or bad ways to be a self? How can one cultivate one's self, or is it better to try to avoid being a self at all? As with any first-year seminar, the course will also involve frequent writing assignments, including both informal exercises and formal argumentative papers.",

    "overview": "An art form called \"Impressionism\" was born in Paris in 1874 when a group of like-minded painters and print-makers showed together in an independent art exhibition. The last of six such shows took place in 1886. Its practitioners continued to hold sway in vanguard circles, and to develop into the 1890s. The key artists were Cassatt, Pissarro, Degas, Caillebotte, Morisot, Renoir and Monet. What were the defining characteristics of this new style called \"Impressionism\"? The paintings and prints represented only the contemporary urban and suburban world (no history; no religion; no mythology) and in startingly novel ways: the pictures were brighter, more freely handled, and oddly evasive than any made before. \n\nThe 2024 celebration of the 1874 exhibition's 150th birthday renewed interest in the history and meanings of Impressionism. The course will take a broad perspective on its interpretation by investigating a wide array of topics: questions of globality, colonialism, and the environment as well as matters of gender, class, modernity, technology, medium and technique. We shall also dip into the work of the successor generation of innovative artists, the so-called \"Post-Impressionists\" (including Seurat, Signac, CÃ©zanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin).\n\nTogether - through your responses to lectures and readings and in the context of class discussion - we will try to make some of the most familiar and admired paintings and prints of the later nineteenth century strange and problematic again.",

This writing seminar will explore cutting-edge social science on how to define this group, relying on timely evidence and centuries-old theoretical debates. The course will also examine how individuals go about maintaining their elite status and passing it on to their children. Through consecutive writing exercises, students will not only refine their understanding of contemporary elites in the United States, but also learn the central tenants of academic writing in the social sciences.",

    "overview": "Medieval romance famously celebrated \"courtly love\"âthe ennobling passion of an aristocratic man for an upper-class woman. But just as deeply ingrained is the ideal of same-sex love between men. And despiteâor perhaps because ofâthe Church's misogynist bias, the culture shows a surprising openness to transgender identities. This class will explore two kinds of texts: those in which women identify as men, and those in which heterosexual love disrupts or is disrupted by male affection. In Ovid's tale of Iphis and Ianthe, two girls (one passing as male) fall in love and marry, while in the life of the transgender saint Marina, a woman who becomes a monk is accused of fathering a child. In Silence, a 13th-century French romance, the \"silenced\" hero/ine is born female but raised male; as a knight, he is charged with homosexuality after rejecting the queen's advances. After our study of ambiguous gender identities, we'll turn to ambiguous desires, reading Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Amis and Amiloun, and selections from The Romance of the Rose. We'll end with Chaucer's \"other masterpiece,\" the magnificent Troilus and Criseyde. Set in ancient Troy, this romance features the ambiguous, bisexual Pandarus, who seems to be in love with both the hero and the heroine. Amis and Amiloun and Troilus and Criseyde will be read in Middle English, the other texts in translation.",

    "overview": "Gender studies have traditionally focused on women. Yet critical work on men and masculinities show us how people of all genders are constrained by gender expectations and assumptions. Furthermore, studies of masculinities shed light on practical questions like, why do men die earlier than women? And, why are men more likely to commit mass shootings? In recent years, the public spotlight has cast light on savory and unsavory aspects of masculinity; think about the rise of the term \"toxic masculinity,\" the #MeToo movement, advertisements aimed at men, and blogs commenting on the behavior of men on the reality show The Bachelorette. In this course, we will go beyond banal statements like \"men are trash\" to critically ask, What role does masculinity play in social life? How is masculinity produced, and are there different ways to be masculine? This course provides students with an intensive introduction to the foundational theory and research in the field of masculinities studies. We will use an intersectional lens to study the ways in which the concept and lived experience of masculinity are shaped by economic, social, cultural, and political forces. As we study the institutions that socialize people into gender, we will examine how the gendered social order influences the way people of all genders perform masculinity as well as the ways men perceive themselves, people of other genders, and social situations. Verbally and in writing, students will develop an argument about the way contemporary masculinity is constructed and performed.",

    "overview": "This course explores the promises and pitfalls of cross-racial political solidarity in the contemporary United States by examining the response of Asian American and Latino communities to Black protest. We begin by studying the construction of racial(ized) groups, focusing on theories of racialization and racial paradigms beyond the black-white binary, and the formation of racial/panethnic categories (e.g., Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian American/AAPI). We then explore histories of solidarity and political coalition-building across Asian, Latino, and Black communities in the U.S. Having established this, we turn our attention to the foundations of anti-Blackness and anti-Black racism in Asian American and Latino communities, employing a comparative-relational lens to further illuminate the barriers to cross-racial coalitions, both before and after the racial uprisings in response to the police killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd in 2020. Lastly, we study how Asian and Latino communities in the U.S. responded to those uprisings over months of sustained Black protest, bringing to bear the foundations and context we have studied to understand and engage in a critical and comparative analysis. Throughout the course we attend to the intersections of race with other identities such as ethnic/national origin, nativity, citizenship status, legal status, class, age, gender, sexuality, and religion.",

    "overview": "This class will take a look at the life and work of the groundbreaking Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud from a comparative and interdisciplinary angle. Almost 80 years after his death, Freud's legacy continues to be controversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others defend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary studies, criminal justice, queer studies, women's studies, communications, and many more. What is certain, however, is that, one way or another, Freud's theories and ideas have marked the world for all time. This class will read fundamental texts from Freud's body of work in dialogue with texts by Freud's near and distant predecessors and followers, both to situate Freud in his historical and cultural context, and to think through the many different kinds of questions that Freud's work addresses.\n\nCLASS IS IN ENGLISH",

    "overview": "Did you know that all the microbes on and in your body weigh as much as your brain? And they can influence your body almost as much as your brain? They can determine how much weight you gain on a certain diet or whether you develop the symptoms of an autoimmune disease, and they can even affect your mood and behavior. Although we have long known the importance of microbes in the context of disease, recent advances in technology have opened up an entirely new field of research that is transforming perspectives on human health. In this course, we will explore the human microbiome beginning with an overview of different types of microbes and the methods we use to study them. Following that, the majority of the course will be dedicated to exploring new research on the microbes of the skin, mouth, gut, and uro-genital tract and their impacts on human health. We will also consider the influence of geography, politics, social structures, and culture on global patterns in the human microbiome and health.",

    "overview": "To guide learning and pedagogical practice, we employ the concept \"historian as curandera [healer].\" Coined by scholar Aurora Levins-Morales, the curandera lens challenges us to engage critical inquiries when exploring untold or unrepresented Latinx hi/stories and social mo(ve)ments. How does positionality affect what one sees/understands? What constitutes evidence? How do historical narratives transform when we center the marginalized? How do we make our work digestible and accessible? Students will create digital archives highlighting curandera hi/stories. Drawing on independent research, students will imagine, engage, and produce curandera hi/stories and embodied responses to curandera principles.",

Over the course of the quarter, we will explore the ways in which Chaucer experiments with late medieval literary genres, from chivalric romances to bawdy fabliaux, frustrating and playing upon the expectations of his audience. Against and alongside this literary context, we will consider the dramatic context of the pilgrimage itself, asking questions about how the character of an individual pilgrim, or the interaction between pilgrims, further shapes our perceptions and expectations of the tales: How is a romance different, for example, when it is told by a knight, by a social climber, or by a renegade wife? We will be reading Chaucer's poem in the original Middle English. At the end of the quarter, we will give an in-class performance of one of the tales.",

    "overview": "The bridging seminar is designed as a forum to generate conversation across anthropology's four subfields. Intended for first year anthropology PhD students, the bridging seminar covers material across the subfields that relates to a specific theme or set of themes that rotates every year. Students are expected to complete readings, attend department colloquium talks, and be an active discussant. This year, we will focus on a mix of external speakers and readings on the hottest topics in linguistic, sociocultural, biological, and archaeological anthropology. Readings will be articles that will be made available as pdfs. There is no paper or exam for this class. Classes will meet approximately three times each quarter, beginning in the fall.",

Almost 80 years after his death, Freud's legacy continues to be\ncontroversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others\ndefend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of\npsychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary\nstudies, criminal justice, queer studies, women's studies, communications, and many more. What is certain,\nhowever, is that, one way or another, Freud's theories and ideas have marked the world for all time. This class\nwill read fundamental texts from Freud's body of work in dialogue with texts by Freud's near and distant\npredecessors and followers, both to situate Freud in his historical and cultural context, and to think through the\nmany different kinds of questions that Freud's work addresses.",

    "overview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry. The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry -- including description, rhetoric, story and song -- and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others -- work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

The course is designed to be stimulating for political science majors, but also highly accessible for non-majors. No prior knowledge of Southeast Asia is required. Stretching between India and China, the eleven countries of Southeast Asia range from poor to rich, tiny to massive, democratic to authoritarian, and from Buddhist to Muslim to Catholic to atheist. No world region is more diverse. The core theme of the course is centered around  struggles for voice and equality. We will grapple with questions like: What does democracy mean under conditions of extreme wealth and poverty? What role does the rule of law play? And why are important democratic gains of the past 25 years eroding? Beyond students interested specifically in Southeast Asia, those doing comparative work on Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and other parts of Asia will find this course useful.\n\nClass descriptions from the past two years can be viewed on the class descriptions page. https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/\nClass descriptions prior to that can be viewed in CAESAR in the Class Search and Catalogs sections.",

    "overview": "The normative appeal of human rights in contemporary politics is an astonishing development. In fact, over the past decades most countries in the world have ratified at least some of the core human rights conventions and treaties. Although human rights have become the lingua franca of international political discourse, there is still a lot of disagreement on what human rights are as well as on what human rights there are. Moreover, on the wake of globalization, it is becoming increasingly difficult to answer the question of who has which human rights obligations towards whom. The traditional answer that only states have human rights obligations towards their own populations is becoming less and less plausible in light of the impact that actions of global economic institutions or transnational corporations have on the ability of states to protect human rights. These difficulties fuel recent criticisms of the human rights project that portray it as either insufficiently ambitious for achieving global justice or even as directly complicit in the perpetuation of injustices. With these problems in view, we will examine the main philosophical approaches to human rights currently under discussion to assess the plausibility of the answers they provide to these difficult normative questions.",

    "overview": "This course has two goals. First, it seeks to familiarize students with Latin American intellectual traditions in the modern period. In order to do so, it surveys a representative selection of pivotal figures in three different, and crucial, historical moments: the post-revolutionary 19th century and its responses both to Independence and an emerging neocolonial order; the frenetic 1920s and 30s and the articulations of a properly Latin American identity and culture; and the late 20th century, which has witnessed an attempt to reckon with the failure of the revolutionary projects of the mid- century. Second, within and across these historical constellations, the course will analyze prominent conceptual paradigms that have defined intellectual discourse in the region, such as anti-colonialism, utopia, mestizaje, hybridity, and heterogeneity, focusing particularly on their evolution and metamorphoses. As we consider the advent and waning of elite, lettered production's influence and power to shape national and regional conceptualizations, we will pay special attention to how universality, particularity, alterity and coloniality inflect the region's intellectual production. Readings will be derived from a list of primary texts with secondary supplements from scholarly sources. Prerequisite: SPANISH 250-0, SPANISH 251-0, SPANISH 260-0, or SPANISH 261-0.",

    "overview": "On October 11th, 2005, E. Patrick Johnson and Mae Henderson's seminal anthology Black Queer Studies was published by Duke University Press. The anthology brought together essays by scholars to assess the strengths and weaknesses of prior work on race and sexuality, highlighting the theoretical and political issues at stake in the nascent field of black queer studies. Following up with his groundbreaking edited collection, Johnson published No Tea, No Shade in 2016. Building on the foundations laid out in Black Queer Studies, No Tea, No Shade spoke new truths about the black queer people, and the black queer experience, whose radical imagination insist on always recalibrating blackness, its embodiment, and performance in an ever-changing political economy. \n\nThe goal of this course is to problematize the terms \"queer,\" \"gender\" and \"sexuality,\" with efforts to question assumptions that attend the usage and deployment of these terms in discourse. This course primarily centers three groundbreaking black queer films - Barry Jenkins' Moonlight (2016), Dee Ree's Pariah (2009), and Kristen Lovell's The Stroll (2023) - as critical, popular, and accessible expressions of black queer theory. We will closely analyze each film alongside other popular culture forms - television shows, performance art, and other visual media - to think about how these texts are in conversation with one another and uncover topics related to black queer genders, sexual practices, vulnerability, queer cultural invisibility, sex work and survival, and LGBTQ kinship. This class will offer students an introduction into black queer theories, analytics, knowledge, and activism that emerge from LGBTQ people of color who examine the intersections of, primarily, race, class, gender, and sexuality, and other vectors of powers and categories of social life. Likewise, this course will expose students to black queer film and media and challenge us, within the academy, to close the gap between popular and academic meditations on black queer life.",

Tailored to the time constraints of the quarter, it introduces students to a series of episodes in the recent history of the study of literature and culture: the influential heroes of these episodes are engaged intellectuals who have together helped to inform how we read today. Pairing a handful of shorter primary texts with field-defining theorists and readers of the past and present, students will not only build fluency in the vocabulary of \"literary theory,\" they will emerge as more worldly, technically savvy, and theoretically sophisticated readers themselves. In this course, we are not interested in theory for its own sake, but in the ways the thing we call \"theory\" â like literature â is not only shaped by, but helps to shape the world around us.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs. This course is the second in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will be asynchronous.",

    "overview": "Time, World, Power: this course explores how audiovisual technologies have contributed to ordering the world by ordering time. First, we will consider the role that cinema has played in reshaping the very idea of time in accord with the demands of capitalism, industrialization, and colonial rule (think, for instance, of temporal calculation and synchronization) and in turning the dictum \"time is money\" into a maxim of subject formation at the very level of the sensorium. Second, we will consider how this logic of temporal control over labor and life has mutated with the diffusion of digital technologies and under the pressure of finance capitalism. Third, we will attend to the ways specific cinematic practices have resisted or subverted this logic and pointed in the direction of non-hierarchical forms of differentiation. Texts from film and media theory, feminist/queer theory, critical race theory, post-autonomist Marxism. Films/installations by John Akomfrah, Charlie Chaplin, Maya Deren, Harun Farocki, William Kentridge, Jean-Luc Godard, Ousmane SembÃ¨ne, Hito Steyerl.",

We will discuss what the international recommendations for safely managed water are and the health and social consequences of water insecurity. The second objective is to explore why there is such variety in water insecurity worldwide. Influences on access to water will be broadly considered; we will draw on literature in global health, ethnography, the life sciences, and public policy. These discussions will be guided by the socio-ecological framework, in which dimensions ranging from the individual to the geopolitical are considered. The third objective is to develop critical thinking and writing abilities to reflect on the multi-dimensional causes and consequences of water insecurity and the appropriateness of potential solutions. This will be accomplished through readings and documentaries that we have lovingly selected, writing weekly reflection pieces, preparing a short in-class presentation on recent media, and writing an OpEd.",

You will be in the field collecting data. We will spend class time discussing your field experiences, conducting relevant exercises, and debating informative readings. The readings will locate field methods within the variety of social scientific methods; raise the logistical, ethical and personal dilemmas you will all face as fieldworkers; and provide examples of how to translate observational data into a coherent and theoretically grounded scholarship. The goals of this course are both to give you the techniques of field research and to make you a better reader and evaluator of the various types of empirical evidence.",

    "overview": "Does the popular genre of the romantic comedy continually renegotiate the social contract? Or do its \"happy endings\" continually impose the safety of closure on love's wayward digressions? This course maps the literary and cinematic DNA of the contemporary \"rom com,\" from William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and the screwball comedies of 1930s Classical Hollywood to the 1990s blockbusters and the Netflix revolution. Along the way we may ask: What do the comedic conventions of Western classical drama, the medieval genre of \"romance,\" or the political aesthetics of Romanticism have to do with the romantic comedy as it exists today? The anarchic space of the \"comedy\" genre is often understood to house a subversive potential, using absurdism or satire to scramble power dynamics or to question social norms governing gender, sexuality, race, and family. One standout question for us will be: Does the romantic comedy threaten to tame the comedy genre's subversive potential? Or does it promise to release its chaotic energies in ever renewed ways? Why do some literary forms and characters seem endlessly adaptable for different social subjects; and how does a screen actor's \"star text\" or public image help direct the genre's history? Students will regularly be asked to watch two movies in a single week. Evaluations are based on participation and preparation; writing several short papers, film analyses, \u0026 response posts; presentation on an episode, scene, or clip from a recent TV show that helps us understood the genre and its history; and a final exam.",

The course will emphasize classic and contemporary work in linguistic variation and change, examining how this variation can reflect social structures, construct diverse social identities, and allow us to make sense of our surrounding social landscapes. We will discuss how quantitative methods in linguistics can be coupled with insights from linguistic anthropology and sociology to engage questions about the social conditioning of linguistic variation, language change, stylistic practice, and the connection between smaller-scale interactions and macro-social patterns of variation. We will also will examine how ideologies about linguistic variation have been used to invalidate particular ways of speaking and disempower speakers of these varieties, exploring the ways that language can reflect, reinforce, or ultimately contest social inequalities.",

We will develop reading and writing skills using Modern Standard Arabic and speaking and listening skills using an educated spoken version of the Ämmiyya of the Levantine dialect.  The integrated approach successfully teaches the reality of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the various settings and contexts of the Arab world.  \n \nWe will cover Units 23-29 which will include a visit to Sarahs' uncle's house, a visit to Syria, a visit with the doctor, vegetables and fruits, and talking on Skype with friends. Instructors will give grammar explanations in Arabic, helping students integrate the new rules to improve speaking and writing. Students will get feedback on their speaking/pronunciation as well as their writing.",

    "overview": "This class examines U.S. playwriting as not only an august and expansive tradition but also, for the last 100 years, a crucial medium by which production teams, public audiences, and private readers have co-participated in critical self-reflection on what \"America\" means to them/us. After a three-week unit devoted to plays and writers that hugely influenced the trajectory of U.S. drama (O'Neill, Bonner, Odets, Miller, Hansberry, Baraka, Kennedy), the bulk of the course privileges artists and texts that sustained but also stretched that legacy from the 1980s onward. These writers (Wilson, Kushner, Parks, Hwang, Baker, et al.) often take America as their explicit subject, in emblematic microcosm or as grand-scale macrocosm, in ways this course will unpack with curiosity and nuance. At the same time, we will sharpen our attention to the structures, semantics, styles, and stagecraft that make these plays such compelling objects of literary analysis as well as cultural-historical contemplation.",

Poring over a range of readings from political speeches and manifestos to 19th century novels and 21st century poetry to love letters and music videos primarily from India and the United States but extending occasionally to Latin America and the United Kingdom, together we will build a framework to understand how colonizers, politicians, freedom fighters, activists, writers, and artists engage discourses of race and caste. We will learn how these and other related terms, and the evolving meanings attached to them, are wielded for political purpose and aesthetic effect, and how they evolve and change over time and across shifting regional and cultural contexts.",

Upon satisfactory completion of the course, students are expected to be able to handle various types of more complex daily conversational situations and short passages on familiar topics. Successful completion of CHINESE 121-3 will satisfy the WCAS foreign language requirement. In addition, they will reach Intermediate mid to Intermediate high in reading, writing, listening and speaking according to ACTFL proficiency guidelines.",

This scholarship has made us increasingly aware of how different Rome was from the modern world. This course will focus on what that difference means for the realities of everyday life, both past and present. Questions to be addressed are: What did economic growth mean for the economy of the Romans? Can we even measure it? What role did energy consumption play in economic performance? What was the role of social class in business? What was the influence of a demographic regime with low life expectancy? How was trade conducted over long distances without fast means of communication and transportation? What was the role of technology and technological progress in the economy?",

Among the topics we will analyze in this sense will be hairstyles, foot-binding, plastic surgery, and, in a deeper sense, bodily practices that inform most fashion-related discourses in East Asia. We will also think through the issue of fashion design, production, and consumption as an often-contested site of modernity, especially in relationship to the issue of globalization and world-market. Thus, we will also include a discussion of international fashion designers, along with analysis of phenomena such as sweatshops.",

To accomplish these two goals, we will use readings, discussions, activities, and brief written assignments to develop our understanding of inequality, and its roots in fundamental aspects of our lives and psychology.",

    "overview": "Nature is one of humanity's most elastic concepts. Sometimes it seems to offer a healing refuge, but sometimes it seems to threaten -- or even contradict -- human survival. Are we part of nature, or do we encounter it? Is human society as natural as the pack or pod, or a defense against \"the laws of nature\"? Both human and literary history have been defined by the stories we tell about the environment; our common future will be shaped the same way. What new forms of attention might address the destabilized ecologies on which we now know we depend?\n\nTracking environmental writing from the ancient Greeks to the Anthropocene, this course offers a deep dive into the storied concept of \"nature\" and the rise of ecological thought and environmental literature. Philosophical reflection began by wondering whether something dystopian separates humanity from the rest of the cosmos. Longstanding ideas of a utopian \"green world\" have offered an escape from the greyness of everyday life and a corrective to the corruptions of the (so-called) \"real world.\" Meanwhile, industrial and technoscientific attempts to \"master\" the earth have scorched it instead, extinguishing countless species and toxifying land, water, air, and our bodies too - proving once and for all that we are a continuous part of the world. Classic literary concerns like close observation, perception, point-of-view, justice, ethics, belonging, and the wild or unknown frontier invariably draw on environmental content. And the way we represent the natural world, in turn, can be as consequential as scientific advances in the great project of preserving our planet.",

    "overview": "This seminar explores health and development policy ethnographically, from the politics of policy-making to the impacts of policy on global health practice, and on local realities. Going beyond the intentions underlying policy, this course highlights the histories and material, political, economic, and social realities of policy and its application. Drawing on case studies of policy makers, government officials, insurance agents, health care workers, and beneficiaries, the course asks: what politics inform which issues become prioritized or codified in health and development policy, and which do not? How do philosophies and values about \"good governance,\" \"best practices,\" \"preparedness,\" or \"economic progress\" influence the kinds of policies that are envisioned and/or implemented? How do politics affect health or medical system governance, and to what effect on the ground? In what ways are policies adapted, adopted, innovatively engaged, or outright rejected by various actors, and what does this mean for the challenges that such policies aim to address? Ultimately, what is the relationship between health politics and health disparities?",

The goal of this course is to develop the ability to calculate efficiently, accurately, and quickly, without excessive emphasis on mathematical rigor. The first quarter covers the practical aspects of: integral calculus, infinite series, complex variables, asymp- totic analysis, and linear algebra. The second quarter will include multi-dimensional integrals and vector calculus, ordinary differential equations, and Fourier analysis.",

    "overview": "Chariot-racing, archery, tennis, and jousting were just some sports enjoyed over the 1000 years (4th-15th centuries CE) known as the \"Middle Ages.\" Kings and queens, monks and nuns, and nobles and peasants engaged in these to gain athletic prowess, fame, status, wealth, love, sex, and fun. This course examines the powerful visual expressions of various sports and games developed, cultivated, and encouraged or discouraged over the medieval era in the Mediterranean world. The evidence includes athletic monuments, illustrated manuscripts, tapestries, and relatively unexpected objects such as mirrors and combs. Modern material, such as films and TV excerpts, shall also be used. Key issues explored are the spectacle and spectatorship of medieval sports; gender, class, and religion in the practice of sports; the body, fashion, and the spaces of sports (stadiums, arenas, etc.), and comparisons between their medieval and modern versions.",

We examine environmental justice writing and artwork with a transnational, interconnected approach. For example, we ask how the Cameroonian-American writer Imbolo Mbue's depiction of pipeline spills in the fictional town of Kosawa connects to Native American resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline. We link a poem documenting silicosis in the lungs of West Virginian coal miners to a novel portraying the aftermath of the Union Carbide gas leak in Bhopal, India. We compare a nonfiction account of Kenyan women resisting deforestation and an iPhone app reclaiming public access along the Malibu coast. We explore questions of voice, genre, and narrative, cataloguing the strategies writers and artists use to reach a global audience.",

    "overview": "Course title: Foodways of Turkey: A Multi-ethnic Look at Food, Culture and Identity \n\nFood represents an integral part of livelihood, culture and identity. Food production, consumption and sharing also have symbolic and ideological meanings. In this course we will explore the complex relationships between food, culture and society through the lens of Turkish food from the Middle Ages to the present. Using an array of primary and secondary sources from history, anthropology, literature, film and media, we will situate culinary practices and their use in constructing and expressing cultural, regional and national identities within the social, historical and political context of Turkey and the wider Middle East. We will study the consumption of and attitudes toward specific foodstuffs, gauging the relevance of items like coffee in the pre-modern world and baklava in modern politics. We will investigate the role of minorities and immigrants in shaping culinary practices in and outside Turkey; the effects of climate change on food production and scarcity; the role of globalization on national cuisine; and representations of Turkish food culture in world literature and film.",

    "overview": "While print novel and magazine readership may be down, podcast listening is hugely popular. Podcasts are now where many people encounter news, pop culture, and stories. Good podcast creatorsâof both fiction and nonfiction podcastsâengage in the art of storytelling, making carefully crafted plots, characters, settings, and themes. This course will expose students to narrative theory and storytelling tools and then teach them to apply these concepts to podcasts. Just as they do with written texts in other courses, students in this course will learn to consider podcasts using close-\"reading\" techniques, rhetorical argumentation, and character, plot, and setting analyses. In addition to these more classical academic analyses of podcasts as literature, the course will also ask students to consider the serial and documentary genres. Furthermore, students will consider how technology affects storytelling. In the first half of the course, students will analyze existing podcasts and write academic papers on the podcasts of their choosing. In the second half of the class, students will make 2 podcasts themselves. One of the podcasts will be an original podcast of their choosing. The other podcast will be a class project wherein students make a podcast that gives other students tips and tricks to improve their writing processes.",

Using a variety of sources, from fiction to art, from bodily modification to textile production, from legal codes to advertisements, we will study both actual garments created and worn throughout history, as well as the ways in which they inform identity markers such as class, ethnicity, nationality, and gender. Among the topics we will analyze in this sense will be hairstyles, foot-binding, plastic surgery, and, in a deeper sense, bodily practices that inform most fashion-related discourses in East Asia. We will also think through the issue of fashion design, production, and consumption as an often-contested site of modernity, especially in relationship to the issue of globalization and world-market. Thus, we will also include a discussion of international fashion designers, along with analysis of phenomena such as sweatshops.",

    "overview": "When you imagine a city, what comes to mind? Perhaps New York, L.A., or Paris? Today, over half of the world's population lives in urban areas, and the most rapid urbanization is happening in cities in Africa and Asia. While urbanization can have positive effects, such as increased wages and accelerated innovation, population growth can also create strain on institutions and infrastructure. In addition, the forces of colonialism, capitalism, and racism exclude certain people and groups from the benefits of urbanization. This course will be organized around key questions. How are the cities that are urbanizing most rapidly today similar to or different from industrialized or post-industrial cities in the Global North? Who has power in a city? What determines this? And what are the implications? \n\nIn this course, we will examine how politics relates to the lives of urban residents around the world, including right here in Chicago. We will engage with work from a variety of different regions (with an emphasis on the Global South) and media (including podcasts, videos, and blog posts). We will discuss theoretical debates with an eye toward how they are relevant to public policy and to people's everyday lives. We will also think critically about how to evaluate the evidence presented for different claims about cities.",

This course is an introduction to sociological research methods. We will learn how to design a research study - everything from choosing a topic and formulating a research question to developing a research plan. We will explore a range of research methods from surveys, interviewing, observational methods and content analysis to \"big\" data approaches. We will also think about the strengths and weaknesses of various sociological methods and what these methods can contribute to our understanding of the social world. We will also debate and discuss the role of the researcher in the research process along with thinking about ethical concerns and IRB protections for research subjects. We will also critically examine how social science research is presented to us in our everyday lives (including news reporting, political polls and social media postings). The goal of this course is for students to be able to design an appropriate methods plan to investigate a sociological research question they are interested in, but also to become more critical when learning about the latest social science study from media and social media outlets.",

We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

While many data science problems can be solved using knowledge from multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R through the IDE RStudio to conduct data science. Students will be introduced to machine learning and will develop skills, tools, and strategies for modeling and understanding complex data. Methods to be addressed include linear regression and classification, tree-based models, model selection, and model assessment, resampling methods, regularization methods. These skills will be developed through project/lab based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). The skills developed in this course are necessary for STAT 301-3 Data Science 3 with R.",

Du Bois wrote in Dusk of Dawn that: \"As American Negroes, we believe in unity of racial effort, so far as this is necessary for self-defense and self-expression, leading ultimately to the goal of a united humanity and the abolition of all racial distinctions.\" Among the many important ideas to which Du Bois words lead, one may find in it justification for the idea that in the face of racial oppression Black Americans have a special duty to unify on the basis of of raceâeven if race distinctions are false or arbitrary. Black American intellectuals have a lengthy history of debating this issue. This course considers this debate. Do African Americans have a duty to unify on the basis of race for the purpose of eradicating racial oppression? We will examine different philosophical theories relating to Black solidarity.",

    "overview": "The central concerns of this graduate seminar are to familiarize students with critical issues, methods, and practices of Queer Theory. Our readings include foundational/early texts naming and/or refusing the topic/discipline itself as well as the way in which the practices of \"reading queerly\" occur in not only what we recognize as theory, but also fiction and film. We will examine and discuss critiques of the Queer Theory canons and work together to create a more relevant, inclusive lineage that considers BIPOC voices, trans theory, critical race theory, diasporic, and transnational texts that supplement the too often white, US-centric field of inquiry. Students will be expected to read carefully and critically, interrogate and analyze the complex intersections of sexualities through cultural and sociopolitical analysis that incorporate gender, race, economic and access disparities and other dimensions reflecting contemporary queer concerns broadly conceived. Close reading will be the primary methodology practiced through class readings and writing, and by the quarter's conclusion, students will create reading lists or possible syllabi they might consider teaching in the future. In addition to this discipline-specific reading list, students will be expected to actively participate in class discussions including leading, singly or in groups, a section of a course meeting. Writing requirements consist of one short close-reading paper and a quarter-long project culminating in a 12-15-page seminar paper on a topic of their choice that demonstrates the production of queer theory from a first-person perspective.",

    "overview": "The Third Eye: Scoring Dance and Performance Art from the Camera Document \n\nDance is unique amongst the arts since, historicallyâand especially in the beginnings of ballet in the court of Louis the XIVâthe lack of proper notation for movement meant that many historically significant ballets were lost and never performed again. There have been attempts to find an adequate language for dance and ways to re-enact performance art more generally, but with changes in technology, the camera has become the witness for history, and thus photography is currently the main way that the live act can exist again. Importantly, the camera that moves around does not function as a distanced or neutral spectator. Rather, the presence and gaze of the camera functions to disrupt and challenge the space(s) of the live act. The archival technology does not simply record the performance but takes part in it as a participant, thus changing the very nature of the performance it documents. \n\nIn this course students will investigate relationships between dance / performance art and its documentation in photography and video. We will study photography and film as they function as an indexical record of ephemeral, temporally fleeting phenomena and how this record becomes the basis for repetition and re-performance. This course focuses on the field of screendance, videodance, or dance-on-camera, working to define this hybrid genre and to understand the collaborative roles of choreographer, director, dancer, cameraman, and video editor. This course is both a practical and scholarly approach to the genre of screendance. Theoretical readings on film theory, performance art, and dance will situate famous works within their greater socio-cultural milieu as a way to investigate their impact on art practices, art spectatorship, and society. Through substantive analysis of course readings, assigned media, creative workshops, and attending live performances, students will develop the skills to analyze both theoretical arguments and works of art. Students will be asked to present on an artist who uses dance and performance in their work in an in-class presentation, write a short reflective paper, participate in movement workshops and create their own movement scores, recorded and edited on their personal media devices. \nEveryone in this class will gets a chance to be behind and in front of the camera as we \nmove!",

    "overview": "This course will introduce you to Queer Theory and theories of sexuality, emphasizing the practice of reading theory from a variety of textual sources as well as conceiving of sexualities in local and transnational contexts. We will query the development of queer theory, beginning with work by Michel Foucault and foundational queer theorists by Eve Sedgwick, Judith Butler, Michael Warner, and Lauren Berlant. We will from standard canonical essays by a variety of queer theorists to essays questioning the politics of a Queer Theory canon and how that might politically occlude relevant voices such as trans and BIPOC contributions. Analysis focuses on textual critiques and cultural studies methodology, including several fictional texts and films. Seminar discussions require attendance and active participation. We will query how queer theory formulates racial, class, and national identities in relation to sexuality, and how it might offer politics beyond those based on identity. Most readings are done on a shared platform (Hypothesis) so students annotate, comment, and reply to each other on all assignments including class readings, midterm essay, and seminar paper.",

This class will consider Jane Austen's development as a writer, in the context of the \"culture wars\" in Britain in the 1790s, in the wake of the French Revolution. Is Austen a radical or conservative novelist? Does she defend the values of a dying aristocracy, or champion a new middle class sensibility? How does she respond to the jarring changes affecting her society? Does she assert the privileges of the governing classes or urge the rights of silenced groups (especially young women)? Does she offer a traditional or progressive view of marriage? Should children make their own choices in marriage or defer to parental authority? How do her novels cultivate good judgment? Do the arts have a progressive role in transforming society or a conservative one in maintaining traditional values? These are some of the questions we will examine as we read a range of her novels. Our goal will be to understand the experimental and fluid nature of Austen's thought, as well as the way in which she transformed the history of the novel.",

    "overview": "Environmental anthropology is a more recent outgrowth of ecological anthropology, which emerged in the 1960s and 70s as a quantitative focus on systemic human-environment relationships, especially as they pertain to patterns of social change and adaptation.  Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s and is typically characterized by qualitative research on communities' engagements with contemporary environmental issues.  Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we'll see in this course, the proliferation of \"new ecologies\" (as opposed to \"new environmentalisms\") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies. This course is divided into two parts.  Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology.  We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, ecofeminism and queer ecologies, and interspecies studies.  Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalism, biodiversity conservation, food justice and environmental justice.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "overview": "Queer Icons in Spain\n\nThis course explores Spanish queer icons of the 20th and 21st centuries, examining their influential work across literature, cinema, television, and philosophy. We will focus on four key figures: Veneno, a sex worker, TV personality, and vedette; filmmaker Pedro AlmodÃ³var; novelist and poet Sara Torres; and philosopher Paul Preciado. Through the lens of queer theory, we will investigate the evolving notion of queerness, historicize its development, and analyze what elevates certain figures to the status of icon, referent, or influencer. Inspired by anarchist pedagogies, the course will involve the collaborative creation of a textbook that compiles our discussions on these icons and queer theory throughout the quarter. This collective book will serve as the textbook for future offerings of this course at Northwestern. Students will have the opportunity to engage with some of the most transgressive works of these queer icons, deepening their understanding of queer theory, while leaving a lasting impact on how future generations of Northwestern students study this subject. Prerequisites: SPAN 204-0 or AP of 5.",

    "overview": "Beginning with the sonnet craze in the late sixteenth century and ending with twenty-first-century reinventions and deconstructions of the sonnet, this course will explore questions of literary history by taking up the relationship between poetry and popular culture, investigating the ways in which poets draw on the latest trends in popular and literary culture and in turn the ways in which that culture incorporates and transforms poetryâon the stage, in music, and on the screen.  Thinking of literary history as a set of conversations in verse across the centuries, we will consider how poets borrow from and respond to one another, experimenting with traditional forms and familiar themes to make the old new.  In order to recognize and interpret this experimentation, we will first study those traditional forms, learning to read and interpret poetry. While we will be reading a range of poems in modern editions, we will be situating them in their social, historical, literary and material contexts, analyzing the ways in which these contexts shape our interpretation.  Readings may include poetry by Shakespeare, Agbagi, Donne, Hughes, Sidney, Keats, McKay, Rosetti, Yeats, and Eliot.",

Readings address questions such as: What is the role of art in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century in view of this so-called breach of civilization? How can we define the relationship between art and politics? How canâor perhaps why shouldâpoetry continue to be written after Auschwitz? Is there such a thing as an \"aesthetics of memory\" and which forms might this take? Important contributions by a variety of influential authors and artists including T.W. Adorno, Peter Weiss, Ruth KlÃ¼ger, Alain Resnais, and Billy Wilder will be discussed in their cultural context. We will also consider the relationship of representation and history in relation to art and memory.\n\nTHIS COURSE IS IN GERMAN",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "This course provides an overview of the multicultural and transhistorical phenomenon of ancient Greek mythology. We will pay close attention to the literary and narrative aspects of the mythological corpus (stories, characters, themes, perspectives, etc.) while interrogating their various material and historical implications. Along these lines, we will consider myths as indicative of Mediterranean intercultural transactions; as ornamental and symbolic presences in everyday artifacts and urban monuments; as symptomatic of or allusive to major military tensions among kingdoms, leagues, and city-states; as religious, ritualistic, and philosophical meditations; as performative tools for dramatic and oratory practices; and as mechanisms to negotiate questions of identity in the messy geopolitical scenario of ancient Greece from the late Bronze Age through the Classical period. By using those premises to explore the heterogenous array of textual and non-textual sources that have served to preserve and transmit the tales, we will foreground the importance of integrating archeological findings, historiographic methods, and socio-political and cultural analyses in the discussion of ancient Greek mythology.",

In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities.",

    "overview": "For good reason, we often discuss or internally experience our genders and sexualities within the terms, frames, and knowledges available to us now. When we admit that genders and sexualities are not just \"inborn\" or unchanging over time, many of the histories we excavate stretch back for centuries. Resisting both impulses, this course uses popular cinema in the US and around the world to assess just how much changes in our notions of gender identity and sexual desire even over short spans of timeâ25 years, to be exact, which is lengthy for those not yet born in 1999-2000 but just yesterday for those of us who were engaged in these conversations and self-discoveries as a new millennium started. Students will learn that all kinds of films, from studio blockbusters to tiny independents, took unusually overt interest in changing categories and expansive experiences of gender and sexuality around the Y2K moment: the era of All About My Mother, Fight Club, Ghost Dog, Boys Don't Cry, But I'm a Cheerleader, Election, and many other enduring touchstones. We will also investigate how evolving fields like feminism and queer theory plus burgeoning scholarship in trans studies and masculinity studies were generating vocabularies, challenging assumptions, and entering into spirited debates in the same moment. Through a combination of discussions and writing assignments, some collective and some self-determined, students will gain valuable skills (how to close-read a movie, how to engage a scholarly article) and also engage in a quarter-long, inquisitive, respectful, and hopefully surprising conversation about the recent past, fluid present, and possible futures of gender and sexuality, on and off screen.",

    "overview": "How do conceptions of \"health\" relate to ideological assumptions about gender, race, class, and sexuality? In this course, we will explore this question through a close examination of a range of activist movements that have attempted to challenge contemporaneous conceptions of health and models of disease. Case studies will include the 19th century birth control and eugenics movements, 1970s-era women's health movement(s) and Black Panther Party \"survival (pending revolution) programs\", ACT UP and AIDS activism, reproductive rights/justice movement activism, breast cancer and environmental activism, mental health activism in the era of psychopharmacology, and recent/ongoing \"mutual aid\" projects. In each case, we will consider how activists frame the problem, the tactics they use to mobilize a diverse group of social actors around the problem, and their success in creating a social movement that challenges contemporary medical models and the ideological assumptions that inform them. The course also introduces students to recent interdisciplinary scholarship on social movements.",

    "overview": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict stands as one of the world's most complex, contested, and debated issues, capturing the attention of scholars, politicians, and the public alike. While everyone seems to have an opinion, its deeper history and dynamics often go overlooked. This course delves into the origins of the conflict, tracing key historical milestones and exploring how both Palestinians and Israelis narrate their experiences. By examining contrasting perspectives and heated debates, students will gain a deeper understanding of the evolving local and global dynamics that have shaped the conflict. Taking a historical lens, the course highlights how both sides have understood and interpreted the conflict over time. Alongside academic readings, students will engage with films, posters, documentaries, and guest lectures. They will also participate in historiographical debates and analyze primary sources, sharpening their ability to critically engage with this complex and enduring conflict.",

    "overview": "Reading the Boom: The Boom and Popular Culture\n\nIn this class, we will examine how \"boom\" writers such as Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, Julio CortÃ¡zar, Mario Vargas Llosa, and others incorporated into their works different accounts of Latin American popular culture (radionovels, boxing matches, music, nightlifeâ¦). In the process, we will examine some of the Boom's characteristic literary traits, the political and social landscapes in which they were producing their work, and some key aspects of modern Latin American rural and urban cultures. Critical accounts of the Boom generation by critics such as Ãngel Rama, Jean Franco, and Pascale Casanova will complement our readings and allow us to question some of the Boom politics related to questions of gender, race, sexual identity, and governmentality.

    "overview": "In his book of essays, Turning the Wheel, novelist and professor Charles Johnson says that Jean Toomer's long poem, \"The Blue Meridian\" (1932): \"offers us a bridge between the black experience and the profound reflections on selfhood long a part of Vedic literature.\" Johnson identifies Toomer's work as a key text within a longer tradition of Black letters that intersect with Vedic and Buddhist philosophies and practices.\n\nConsidering the buzz word \"mindfulness,\" this undergraduate course explores the extended tradition of spiritual, contemplative, and ancient practices influencing Black letters since the 19th century. Alluding clear and consistent definition, \"mindfulness\" is an umbrella term that includes contemplative practices, embodiment, transcendentalism, and many other lines of spiritual and secular strategies for survival and more. This course will consider how stillness, concentration, and focus on interiority provide alternative and complementary strategies for Black survival and thriving.\n\nWe will read works by Johnson and Toomer, Paschal Beverly Randolph, Paule Marshall, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Zora Neale Hurston. Additionally, we will consider the theory and criticism of Howard Thurman, Kevin Quashie, Martin Luther King, Jr., and others along with Buddhist, Vedic, and West African religious texts and studies to consider the many sides of a Black mindfulness literary tradition. We will contemplate the theory and praxis of meditation, transcendence, tantra, Dharma, ritual, and possession. Additionally, we will create and execute our own mindfulness exercises and consider how they may or may not support various politics of Blackness in our current moment.\n\nThis course will require active and enthusiastic participation by everyone in the class. There will be four response papers/discussion board writing assignments, group presentations, and ongoing experimentation with mindfulness, and a final project that will engage writing as well as other media. Journaling is highly recommended for this course, as well.",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning.

Understanding fashion as a modal practice that aestheticizes culture enables a deeper query into how identity becomes layered and expressed by and through the body across various contexts. In this course, students will each investigate the relationship between Latinx culture and fashion to consider how meaning is rendered and produced through the lens of race, gender, and sexuality. We will be focusing on how our upbringing influences the way we dress and how we feel in our body. Consequently, this class considers the home as a valuable site of knowledge production, considering how personal narrative, objects, and memory, underpin our understanding and experiences of fashion often rooted in survival. In doing so, this course will consider how media portrayal of fashion at the mainstream and local level across the late 20th century and 21st century overlaps with Latinx cultural histories and nostalgia. To develop our methodological wardrobe, we will engage with an array of critical texts and objects that highlight the intersections of gender, nationality, race, and class to understand the implications of fashioning culture on the body, that stratify between the runway and everyday life. This course will feature in-class workshops, artist talks, social media analysis (i.e: YouTube, TikTok), film, photography, and other media, culminating with a final creative project.",

The study of human origins, or paleoanthropology, is a subfield of physical anthropology that focuses on the biological history of the human species including their evolution, emergence, and radiation. We will explore the scientific method and how theories like evolution have come about and expanded over time. We will learn about our closest living relatives - primates - and how an appreciation of their life history and behavior reflects the modern human condition. Many of the principles and concepts that comprise our understanding of how humans have evolved and adapted over time involve an appreciation of ecology, genetics, physiology, adaptation, and cultural development that will also be explored. Lastly, we will look at modern human diversity and discuss how we are continuing to evolve today.",

Quality data visualizations have the power to help analysts better understand and effectively communicate their work. Students will learn how to construct quality data visualizations using RStudio. The course will address visualizing data of various forms (e.g. panel, spatial, temporal, etc.) and from various statistical domains such as inferential, descriptive, and predictive statistics. The course will focus on principles and techniques used to create static visualizations. The course will also provide an introduction to interactive visualizations and dashboards. These skills will be developed through project/lab-based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). A significant proportion of the course will be dedicated to a large-scale project.",

    "overview": "The production of commercial prints in Japan was the result of a popular revolution in Japanese society. Japan's great premodern cities, especially Edo (now Tokyo), were home to an increasingly prosperous, sophisticated, and literate urban dweller who would purchase images of their favorite celebrities of the day or the latest illustrated novel.  This class will explore the birth of the commercial Japanese print, and its many incarnations leading to the designs of contemporary artists. During our discussions we will consider the changing role of the artist and issues of use and reception, including the part the West played in maintaining the popularity of Japanese prints into the 20th century. \n\nAlong with art historical analysis and a study of the commercial context of the prints, issues of connoisseurship will feature strongly in this class taught from a curatorial point of view. As this class will be conducted largely in the Art Institute's Japanese print storage area, it is a rare opportunity to view works of art up close and unframed, essential for an understanding of printing techniques and collecting practices.",

We will take a critical approach to the idea of \"literature\" by analyzing, for example, Indigenous texts and engravings alongside historical, ethnographic, and religious documents. While introducing students to the historical contexts in which colonial era texts were written, this course will focus on how Indigenous cultures and communities articulated, transformed, and preserved their identities into the late 19th century. While the primary language of the class will be Spanish, we will also consider the linguistic diversity of Latin America through translations of works in Indigenous languages.

A starting premise for this course is this: rather than being outside politics (articulated in the plea that athletes âjust shut up and play ball'), sport has been a means for bolstering nationalism and national belonging; a staging ground for a range of social, political and economic ideologies; and a vehicle for social protest and change. We examine this premise through a close and careful reading of ethnographic and popular texts; together, we will analyze and discuss anthropological theories of value, power, kinship, violence, difference and social hierarchy through the lens of sports.",

We will investigate what it means to write for the ear (as opposed to the page or screen), and we will learn to connect with the listener. In the process of producing multiple audio works, we will acquire numerous audio production skills. We will write frequently, speak frequently and in varied styles. We will use field mics and studio mics as we harness our unique voices and the voices of others. We will also compute a fair bit as we learn to use audio editing software to produce polished, multilayered soundscapes. By winter's end, we will be more practiced writers, more accomplished multimedia performers and producers, possess a greater number of technological skills and a greater range of artistic expression.",

    "overview": "Topic: Points of View in Fiction\n\nThis course is intended to help you develop writing skills that will help you succeed while you are at Northwestern -- and also after you graduate. The theme for this section will be \"points of view\" in fiction. We will read short stories, and you will be introduced to eleven different \"modes of narration,\" or ways of telling a story. Many of the readings will be taken from an unusual collection of short stories, Points of View, edited by James Moffett and Kenneth R. McElheny, in which the stories are categorized according to the mode of narration used in the story. One section of the anthology contains \"interior monologues,\" in which we seem to be inside the main character's head, overhearing his or her thoughts; another section contains \"dramatic monologues,\" in which we hear the narrator speaking aloud to another character; a third section contains \"epistolary\" stories (stories told in letters); a fourth contains stories that consist of diary entries; and so on.  We will look at eleven modes of narration in all and read two examples of most modes.  Students will write two academic essays and two short narratives. The academic essays will be drafted, workshopped, and revised to help students develop their essay-writing skills.",

    "overview": "\"Sociology of Disaster\"\n\nDisasters are catastrophic events with human and natural causes and may be gradual or sudden and unexpected. What these events share is their potential to disrupt communities, displace residents, and cause economic, emotional, and social suffering. We know that disasters are on the rise globally and in the US, incurring significant economic and social consequences. The aim of this course is to understand how disasters like pandemics, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, plane crashes, oil spills, and terrorism provide a \"strategic research site\" where we can examine social life and inequality. In this course, students will be introduced to the idea that disasters are fundamentally social events. We will focus on the social, political, and economic conditions that influence disaster experience and recovery, paying special attention to the ways that social characteristics like race, class, gender, and age structure social vulnerability to risk before, during, and after disasters. In learning to think critically about prevailing media representations of disasters, students will master content analysis methodology by engaging in a term-long research project in which they study one recent disaster event and the associated media coverage. This is an introductory level course without any prerequisites.",

Using the tools of microeconomic analysis and some econometrics, this course will define and examine \"environmental problems\" in terms of economic efficiency. We will also discuss the methods (and shortcomings of these methods) used by economists and policymakers to place dollar values on environmental amenities (since such valuations will determine what policy options are deemed \"efficient\"), such as benefit-cost analysis. Then we will apply these tools to look at a particular set of environmental problems caused by negative externalities transmitted through naturally occurring amenities, and the effects of the policies we construct in response to these problems.

The course will provide an overview of the logic and method underlying empirical research in human biology.  The course will introduce students to the scientific method, as well as the process of research design, data analysis and interpretation.  The course emphasizes hands-on laboratory experience with a range of methods for assessing human nutritional status, physical activity, growth, cardiovascular health, endocrine activity and immune function.  In contrast to clinical or biomedical approaches to human biology, biological anthropologists tend to study a diverse range of individuals in everyday settings.  Therefore, an emphasis will be placed on minimally-invasive research methods that can be applied across a range of cultural and ecological contexts.",

In longstanding democracies including the United States, democratic institutions have faced historically unprecedented strain from populist movements such as Trumpism. Looking to the future, democracies likely will encounter novel challenges resulting from phenomena such as artificial intelligence and climate change. This course will survey recent trends in democratic backsliding, drawing on both classic studies of why democracies collapse and emerging research about uniquely 21st century threats to democracy. We will also consider potential political strategies and reforms for promoting the resilience of democracies.",

    "overview": "From the mythic landscapes of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to the cosmic confederations of Ursula K. Le Guin's Hainish novels, speculative worlds often capture and dazzle our imaginations. But what exactly makes a particular world compelling? Why do writers build their own worlds and settings? What histories do they draw on, and what futures do they imagine? In this course, we'll examine various examples of worldbuilding, worldmakingâor, as Octavia Butler terms it, worldweaving. We'll analyze how writers evoke a sense of \"world\" across multiple scales through the ecologies, atmospheres, characters, politics, and languages that they craft. In the first few weeks of the course, we will discuss worldmaking through historical lenses, from creation myths and origin stories to medieval maps and early modern utopian fiction. Then, we will move onto more contemporary texts such as Tillie Walden's On A Sunbeam and Cathy Park Hong's Dance Dance Revolution, investigating how writers weave speculative worlds with lived experiences and discourses of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. By the end of the course, we will look to other mediums, such as video games and tabletop role-playing, to consider the immersive potential of worldmaking practices. This course is primarily a writing course. Writing comes into being not only through recording your thoughts on paper, but also through reading, analyzing, and engaging with the world around you. Through short analytical assignments building up to a longer research paper, we will reflect on the ways in which our own practices of writing bring us closer to the worlds we wish to inhabit and the worlds we wish to make.",

    "overview": "\"By transforming love into romance, capitalist society allows us to continue desiring.\" By structuring satisfaction as ever incomplete, capitalism propels us to seek \"the new, the better, and the more,\" writes film scholar Todd McGowan. Testing this contention on the \"psychic costs of free markets,\" this class will take students to mid-nineteenth century Paris, when the modern iconic city of romance, with its elegant bridges, wide boulevards, endless fashion displays, and vibrant cafÃ© life, was created in the capitalist transformation of its physical space and social relationships. Based on readings from feminist and queer theory, urban geography, sociology, art history, literature, and social history, we will use these various perspectives to study our main laboratory: the massive urban renewal projects under Baron Haussmann during the Second Empire of Napoleon III that demolished the twisted winding streets of old Paris to build a modern capital city of commerce and leisure. Using three of Emile Zola's novels on the \"Haussmannization\" of Paris, we will examine how changes in the physical structure altered the old connections between illicit sexualities and nonconforming gender practices. We will investigate how the new department stores, apartment buildings, the cafÃ©-concerts, open-air promenades, and parks promoted bourgeois gender norms and sexual identities.  In turn, we will ask how, with its new opportunities and deep losses, the moral economy of capitalism (its logic of production, profit taking, and social transactions) encouraged new subjectivities that ultimately reshaped both public and intimate spaces, as well as notions of pleasure and criminality.  Most importantly, we will ask: what happened to love? The class combines lectures, in-class discussions, with short weekly assignments. With the guidance of the instructor, students will design and write a research paper (7 to 10 pages) reflecting on these topics.",

    "overview": "In 2016, Taylor Swift's highly publicized feud with Kanye West and the Kardashians peaked with the release of Kanye's song, \"Famous,\" which features a derogatory reference to the pop artist. In response to Taylor's outrage, Kim Kardashian released a recorded phone call between Taylor and Kanye in which she seemed to approve the controversial lyric, and called Taylor a \"snake.\" This suggestion of Taylor's deceit spread quickly through public opinion, and #TaylorSwiftisaSnake went viral across social media platforms. What does it mean to call a woman a snake? What does such a comparison seek to express about someone's intentions, or even their ethics? And what happens when women accused of sn(e)akiness lean into rather than away from the comparison? We will consider these questions in a winding investigation of snakey women through the ages and across a variety of narrative forms. From the bond between Eve and a serpent in the biblical story of Adam and Eve's fall from grace to the bond between dragon-rider Rhaenyra Targaryen and her dragon (HBO series, \"House of the Dragon\"), from Melusine, a medieval folkloric figure cursed with the body of a serpent from the waist down, to Medusa, the monstrous snake-haired woman of Greek mythology, this class will examine how premodern and modern representations of serpentine femininity treat issues of gender and power.",

    "overview": "When half-British, half-Malaysian actor Henry Golding, was cast in Crazy Rich Asians (2018), controversy abounded over whether Golding was \"Asian enough\" to play the role. While some accused Hollywood of whitewashing, Golding responded that he was \"Asian through and through.\" Political figures including Barack Obama and Kamala Harris have likewise been subject to questions around how they represent their racial identities. These debates raise questions about how those who are multiracial or multiethnic are allowed to claim and perform their racial identities when simultaneously characterized as too much and not enough. At the same time, these conflicts also highlight the complicated combination of racism and privilege that mixed-race individuals (and especially those who are white passing) experience. Through novels, essays, and short stories, we will explore the mixed feelings and experiences of being mixed race in America from the nineteenth century to the present. We will consider how the legacy of slavery and the one-drop rule continues to influence racial politics today while contradictory policies imposed on Indigenous communities have been leveraged to reduce Indigenous sovereignty. Other topics we will discuss include racial fluidity and ambiguity, performance, and intergenerational tension.",

    "overview": "Abolitionist politics demand sustained and nuanced critiques of world systems and an end to the ways they enact violence. To this end, to engage in abolitionist feminism is to consider assumptions around criminal punishment and carcerality, with an explicit attention to Black, Latinx, Indigenous, queer, and trans perspectives. From this vantage, this course will examine borders, both national and intimate, as one of the most violent and carceral spaces of our time. We ask, for example: What does it mean to abolish borders? What is the difference between this and open borders? Is the abolishment of ICE and other forms of border policing sufficient? Similarly, how has the social sphere adopted border logics? What do Indigenous \"land back\" initiatives look like under abolition? How might we \"rehearse life\" under current oppressive regimes as we work toward abolitionist futures?",

Different architectures of neural networks will be covered, implementing software that analyzes data in image and time-series format. The students are expected to have a basic understanding of ML concepts and terminology from the Data Science (STAT 301/303-1-2-3) sequence, on which the course builds a more mathematical foundation. The coding language is Python, which will be used to implement ML/DL projects on a variety of datasets.",

We will continue to use INTERMATIK as our core grammar online resource, discuss everyday culture of German-speaking countries, and read an excerpt from a play by Bertolt Brecht to continue our exploration of modern German literature. In the fall quarter we read a 19th century romantic story, in the winter we will discuss 20th century Germany, and in the spring, a contemporary piece from the 21st century awaits. The primary goal is to develop proficiency in all German language skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing). Class activities will be communicative and, in the winter and spring quarters you will have a chance to converse individually with German native speakers online. No purchase necessary; all materials are sponsored by the German department.",

    "overview": "On October 13, 54 CE, the Roman emperor Claudius died, allegedly poisoned by his wife Agrippina. His death was kept silent until she had made arrangements for her son Nero to succeed to Claudius. He was buried with regal pomp and accorded divine honors. What happened next \"in heaven\" is narrated in the only surviving example of prose-and-verse satire from the Roman world.\n\nThis course focuses on the relationship between literature and power in the age of the emperor Nero. The primary materials will consist of a close reading of the \"Apocolocyntosis\", a satirical pamphlet attributed to Lucius Annaeus Seneca lampooning the death and deification of the emperor Claudius, along with selected passages from Seneca's \"De Clementia\", a treatise written by Nero's tutor and advisor with the stated aim of depicting the ideal ruler for the recently acclaimed young emperor. While conducting a literary and historical analysis of these texts, we will address questions of genre, political ideology, and dissent.  Students enrolled in the class will work collaboratively to produce a translation suitable for a staged reading of the \"Apocolocyntosis\", the most mordant political satire on a Roman Emperor that has come down to us from the Early Empire and one of the funniest and most baffling products of the Neronian age.",

    "overview": "The human body is embedded into a health framework that can produce hypervisibility, invisibility, or both. This course in social science and medical anthropology examines the role of social markers of difference, including race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, in current debates and challenges in the theory and practice of global health. We will explore recent illness experiences, therapeutic and self-care interventions, and health practices and behaviors in socio-cultural and historical context through case studies in the U.S., Brazil, and South Africa. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, social determinants of health, biopolitics, health equity, and an ethic of care. Central questions of the course include: How do categories of \"Othering\" determine disease and health in individuals and collectives? How is medical science and care influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient trust? How do social and economic inclusion/exclusion control access to health treatment and self-care and care of others? This course focuses on the linkages between society and health inequalities in the U.S. and economic powers. It offers a forum to explore policy application with a particular emphasis on definitions that form social factors. This course utilizes historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, Twitter threads of health experiences, public health literature, media reports, TedTalks, and films to bring to life the \"why's\" of health differences.",

In this class we will dive into the universal topic of relationships between parents and children as it is reflected in Israeli society. We will examine this topic through the lens of various genres, such as short stories, blogs, films, parental guides and TV shows, and we will even taste a bit of creative writing. As we discuss the complexities and dilemmas of the relationships we encounter and ask ourselves if there is something like \"Israeli parenthood\" or \"Israeli childhood\", we will also pay close attention to the varied language levels and styles, grammar structures and vocabulary.",

This course studies basic methodological problems in policy analysis and presents applications. Instruction includes lectures and class discussion.

Key questions of the course will include: how and why has trauma become one of the most important signifiers of our eraâand a key criterion of \"victimhood?\" What politics and debates have shaped the development and application of the PTSD diagnosis in recent decades? And how have notions of trauma and their varied applications transformed politics, suffering, and care in diverse communities around the world?",

In the fall quarter we read a 19th century romantic story, in the winter we will discuss 20th century Germany, and in the spring, a contemporary piece from the 21st century awaits. The primary goal is to develop proficiency in all German language skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing). Class activities will be communicative and, in the winter and spring quarters you will have a chance to converse individually with German native speakers online.

Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, practices and forms of knowledge production characteristic of what we call \"global health\" today, and explores the environmental, social, political and economic factors that shape patterns and experiences of illness and healthcare across societies. We will scrutinize the value systems underpinning specific paradigms in the policy and science of global health practice, and place present-day developments in historical perspective. As an introductory course on global health, the class delves into comparative health systems, including comparative health systems in high- and low-income countries. Key topics will include: policies and approaches to global health, key actors in global health, comparative health systems, structural violence, gender and reproductive health, chronic and communicable diseases, politics of global health research and evidence, and the ethics of global health equity.",

This class in social metaphysics will focus on questions related to the behavioral regularities that hold across members of a group.  In particular, we will closely consider the differences between social kinds, social norms, conventions, and other kinds of social facts. To explore these topics, we will take an interdisciplinary path. We will anchor the conversation in philosophy but weave in and out of the social and cognitive sciences while considering how and why different regularities seem to hold. In addition to understanding how regularities obtain, we will also focus on how to change such regularities when they are harmful or oppressive to members of a group.",

    "overview": "This course provides an overview of some of the major trends in Latin American literatures since 1888, while at the same time offering opportunities to improve students' oral and written Spanish. The course will emphasize various literary styles and ideological constructions that, in different ways, reflect the complexity of Latin American writing. While introducing students to the social and historical context in which the works were written, the course will focus on the following issues: the cultural and political dimensions of literature; the representation of class, gender, and race; the formative impact of nationalism and internationalism; and the concern for finding autochthonous modes of expression. This course also satisfies the Global Overlay requirement. During the quarter, students will discuss assigned primary texts as well as, crucially, the broad historical, political and social processes that shaped literary and cultural production at the end of the 19th and the 20th centuries in Latin America.  The nature and complexity of these processes will be presented and engaged through lecture and discussion of scholarship on these topics. We will pay particular attention to the cultural and historical bases of literary traditions as constituted by the encounters, conflicts, tensions, and transformations of the period. Our goal is to generate the knowledge and develop the skills necessary to grapple with key issues including colonialism, empire, indigeneity, cultural imposition, transformation, memory, translation, the legacies of extractivism, ethnicity, race, and immigration.

    "overview": "As cultural critic Ariana Grande once said, \"I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it!\" Some hundred years before, Karl Marx warned about consumerism and alienation: \"Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.\" Taking the iconic makeover scene as its guiding trope, this course considers the preoccupation with gender, sex, and the performance of femininity that lies at the heart of modern consumer culture. How are racial and gender boundaries constructed and enforced through consumerism? Can one truly purchase empowerment? Are there, in fact, some ways in which consumerism offers key avenues for self-fashioning, and the subversion of heteronormative gender performance? While this course begins in 1725 with Eliza Haywood's Fantomina and a brief survey of antecedents, the majority of texts are literature, film, and pop culture ephemera from the 1990s through today. Texts include Curtis Sittenfeld's Prep, Bong Joon-ho's best picture winning Parasite, and Greta Gerwig's latest satire Barbie. Students will engage with Marxism, feminism, gender theory, and sociological thought to construct a modern pop canon of consumption. According to interest, students will also be expected to track a vlogger/influencer of their choice in a pop culture journal.",

    "overview": "The term \"Middle Ages\"âthe period \"in the middle\" between classical antiquity and the Renaissanceâderives from European history, and it's problematic even there. But the global turn in medieval studies enables us to go beyond the field's traditional focus on Europe alone to explore its ties with the rest of the known world. In this course we'll do that in two ways. Our first unit will deal with romance, gender, and the aesthetics of eroticism. Court ladies feature as foundational romance authors in two island nations, England and Japan, at opposite ends of the Eurasian land mass. After reading the Lais of Marie de France (12th century) and selections from the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (11th century), we'll complicate our study with two transgender romances: Heldris of Cornwall's Silence and a Japanese tale translated by Rosette Willig as The Changelings. In our second unit, dealing with travel and ethnography, we'll consider two Islamic and two European works: The Book of Ibn Fadlan (921-22), The Mission of Friar William of Rubruck (1253-55), The Travels of Ibn Battutah (1325-54), and The Book of John Mandeville (ca. 1356). Critical readings will include literary essays on the French and Japanese texts, as well as excerpts from Geraldine Heng, The Invention of Race in the European Middle Ages; Shayne Aaron Legassie, The Medieval Invention of Travel; and Shirin Khanmohamadi,  In Light of Another's Word: European Ethnography in the Middle Ages.",

Why were slavery and settler colonialism so important to so many constitutional histories? This course takes up these and other questions in order to make sense of the interplay between laws, empires, and corporate entities around the world over the last four centuries (circa 1600 to 2000). We will examine: 1) the origins and effects of mixed jurisdictions (or legal pluralism) in different regions; 2) the ways empires have shaped key concepts of sovereignty and citizenship; 3) the role of transnational corporations in bolstering imperial rule; 4) the roots of empire in the history of human rights and international law; 5) scientific versus legal definitions of racial identities and indigeneity; and 6) entanglements between cultural and intellectual property.",

In contrast to the shiny castle of the villainous Lord Farquaad, Shrek's cozy home inverts the swamp's typical representation as a magical but potentially sinister space. This course takes Shrek's order as a provocation: why must we leave? Is it dangerous to remain in the swamp, and for whom? In this course, we will explore swamps, bogs, and wetlands through a variety of mediums, including literary fiction (Jeff VanderMeer's Annihilation); television episodes (\"It's a Swamp Thing\" from Harley Quinn); and videogames (Dark Souls 3). Our class will also approach our own campus environment, the Great Lakes wetlands, with curiosity and care through site-specific activities outside of the classroom. The primary goals of this course are to improve your writing, hone your research skills, and refine your critical thinking strategies. To that end, we will approach writing as a process rather than a product; in addition to writing in multiple genres, you will work with your classmates in a peer-review process, providing and responding to substantial feedback. In venturing into the wetlands together, this class will help first-year students acclimate to Northwestern and improve their critical thinking and writing skills.",

As we examine the turbulent social and political contexts in which these works emerged, we will also explore how and why the works of these artists caused such moral and critical outrage in audiences of the time.",

They can be playful and helpful, or menacing and malevolent. They can be figments of the imagination that crumble under the harsh glare of science, or they can be very real. And they can tell us about the fears, desires, and longings of the humans who encounter them.\n\nIn this class, we will read stories by Hindi and Urdu writers like Naiyer Masud, Uday Prakash, Qurratulain Hyder, Premchand, Vijaydan Detha, and Phanishwarnath Renu, and watch films like Paheli, Mahal, and Nagin. With the help of scholars of literature, history, and anthropology, we'll think about what and how these texts mean, and about how they have been translated and adapted across languages and media.\n\nAll readings will be available in both Hindi (Devanagari) and Urdu (Nastaliq) scripts.",

    "overview": "In his book of essays, Turning the Wheel, novelist and professor Charles Johnson says that Jean Toomer's long poem, \"The Blue Meridian\" (1932): \"offers us a bridge between the black experience and the profound reflections on selfhood long a part of Vedic literature.\" Johnson identifies Toomer's work as a key text within a longer tradition of Black letters that intersect with Vedic and Buddhist philosophies and practices.\nConsidering the buzz word \"mindfulness,\" this undergraduate course explores the extended tradition of spiritual, contemplative, and ancient practices influencing Black letters since the 19th century. Alluding clear and consistent definition, \"mindfulness\" is an umbrella term that includes contemplative practices, embodiment, transcendentalism, and many other lines of spiritual and secular strategies for survival and more. This course will consider how stillness, concentration, and focus on interiority provide alternative and complementary strategies for Black survival and thriving.\n\nWe will read works by Johnson and Toomer, Paschal Beverly Randolph, Paule Marshall, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Zora Neale Hurston. Additionally, we will consider the theory and criticism of Howard Thurman, Kevin Quashie, Martin Luther King, Jr., and others along with Buddhist, Vedic, and West African religious texts and studies to consider the many sides of a Black mindfulness literary tradition. We will contemplate the theory and praxis of meditation, transcendence, tantra, Dharma, ritual, and possession. Additionally, we will create and execute our own mindfulness exercises and consider how they may or may not support various politics of Blackness in our current moment.\n\nThis course will require active and enthusiastic participation by everyone in the class. There will be four response papers/discussion board writing assignments, group presentations, and ongoing experimentation with mindfulness, and a final project that will engage writing as well as other media. Journaling is highly recommended for this course, as well.",

What's the role of illness in shaping changing perceptions of the environment? How has race been central to the construction and treatment of disease? How has gender shaped conceptions of and approaches to health? What historical role have issues of gender, race, and class played in the inequitable distribution of pollution and in activist involvement in combating environmental hazards? How has changing food production and culture shaped health?

    "overview": "Marvel or Monstrosity?\n\nEvery culture produces artworks embodying the ambivalence specific to their historical moment or even concerning broader existential anxieties. Marvelous and monstrous beings can represent acute cultural anxieties or imaginaries, such as social fears about change through secularization, modernization, and changing understandings of markers of modern identity such as gender, sexuality, race, and species or life-forms. Further, what do these fascinating figures reveal about the self, which is often perceived in relation to others and individual conflicting desires? Why do we continue to produce expressions of socio-political, psychological and historical ambiguity through representations of life forms perceived to be marvelous or monstrous? Through a selection of narrative fiction, visual representation, films, and critical essays, this seminar examines significant sites of cultural fascination and the anxieties played out in these representations. As our course is a First-Year Seminar, we will also discuss various aspects of college academic life, as well as working towards a consolidation and an expansion of analytical and writing skills that you have already developed during your first year as a university student.",

    "overview": "As we grapple with the urgencies of the present, what are the politics (and promise) of telling more complex and nuanced stories of activism and social change? In recent years, the \"second wave\" of feminism (1968-1980) has increasingly been conflated with \"white, middle-class feminism\" and critiqued as an exclusionary form of feminist politics in contrast to the more intersectional feminist politics of the \"third\" and \"fourth\" waves of feminism. Numerous historians of the period have challenged us to reconsider this claim, which elides \"feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past\" and risks missing \"some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today\" (Enke 2018). In this course, we will begin by exploring which projects, groups, and concerns have come to define the \"second wave\" (and subsequent \"waves\") of feminism in the United States in our collective memory. We then turn to recent histories of the \"second wave,\" coupled with oral histories from movement participants, that challenge us to reconsider what counts as \"feminist politics\" during this period. For example, histories that focus on the formation of broad-based coalitions across and between liberation movements around issues of economic justice, reproductive rights, and the right to \"self-defense\" against both interpersonal and state violence during this period, challenge us to expand our conception of feminist activism. In the process, they require us to incorporate the \"critical insights and knowledges\" of labor and welfare rights activists, sex workers and gay liberationists, Black, Chicana, Puerto Rican and Indigenous liberation movement members as central to the feminist politics of the period. Guided student research into ongoing/current feminist projects (e.g. SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, Chicago Abortion Fund, Survived\u0026Punished, Critical Resistance, Sylvia Rivera Law Project) aid us in identifying the legacies of this historical period in feminist activism in 2025.",

    "overview": "The question of ancestral ties and roots is at the root of some of the most pressing dynamics in the Middle East today. But what exactly does \"ancestry\" mean? What do people mean when they talk about \"roots\"âof a nation, of humankind, an ethnoreligious group, a \"race,\" or of individuals? How do people prove or enact ancestry, whether through blood, language, cultural affinity, or other tacit knowledges? What political claims do people make related to their genetic and cultural descent? This course examines these questions by looking into historical, social, and legal processes in which ancestries are curated. Through an interdisciplinary lens, we will study diverse ways in which people in the Middle East have understood the question of origins and ancestry, and we will analyze ideologies and values attributed to heredity. We will read ethnographies, historical accounts, philosophical texts, mythologies, and fiction to have a better grasp of the kinds of claims that frame ancestry as a foundation of, and a prop for broader entitlements. Special attention will be given to religious, ethnoracial, spatial, socioeconomic, and gendered understandings of ancestry.",

    "overview": "The phrase \"rule of law\" conveys a range of expectations we have of government and each other. Is the rule of law a meaningful aspiration for a legal system that is fair and ensures everyone, including government officials are equally accountable? Or is the phrase a cynical ruse on behalf of the powerful to control wealth, territory, and populations? This course will explore the origins of the rule of law in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law and politics. The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Max Weber, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives.\n\nThis class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?\n\nPlease note that there are no formal prerequisites, but students who have not had previous classes in political theory may find this class challenging. POLI_SCI 201 or equivalent would be helpful.\n\nPOLI_SCI 309-0 and LEGAL_ST 309-0 are taught together; may not receive credit for both courses.",

At the beginning of the term, students will complete a needs assessment to determine which aspects of spoken English are most critical for current communication skills. These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

We routinely ingest, for example, infographics about demographic trends, media coverage on crime and undocumented immigration, and advertisements for ancestry tests. In complex and contextually specific ways, this diet shapes our personal and collective identities, social interactions and relationships, and political aspirations and anxieties. In this course, we endeavor to study the politics of racial knowledgeâthe ways in which categories, measurements, and other techniques of knowledge production have helped to constitute \"race\" as a seemingly objective, natural demarcation among human populations and institute forms of racial domination and inequality. Historically, racial knowledge has stipulated and legitimated what we might describe as a kind of racial ontology, a set of assumptions, claims, and prescriptions about race and racial superiority/inferiorityâe.g., the notion that \"whites\" or \"the West\" represent the apex of human civilization. Drawing on diverse texts, this course explores of the emergence, evolution, and effects of racial knowledge. This exploration will begin by discussing the historical relationship between the modern concept of race and European colonialism and slavery. Subsequently, we will track several major developments in the history of racial knowledge, from Enlightenment naturalists to censuses to contemporary genomics research.",

Drawing on Foucault's History of Sexuality and his work on governance, health, and resistance, the course examines how the management of life, risk, and public health during both crises reflects broader structures of control and societal response. By investigating the medical, governmental, and activist discourses surrounding HIV/AIDS, and asking to what extent these frameworks can inform our understanding of the COVID-19 era, the seminar encourages a reflection on how epidemics reshape public perceptions of the body, sexuality, and state power. Through this lens, students will critically explore the historical, social, and cultural dynamics of a pandemic, as well as the evolving relationships between health, power, and resistance.",

    "overview": "Across all industries, employers consistently rank written and oral communication in the top five skills that a new employee needs. However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

    "overview": "As we grapple with the urgencies of the present, what are the politics (and promise) of telling more complex and nuanced stories of activism and social change? In recent years, the \"second wave\" of feminism (1968-1980) has increasingly been conflated with \"white, middle-class feminism\" and critiqued as an exclusionary form of feminist politics in contrast to the more intersectional feminist politics of the \"third\" and \"fourth\" waves of feminism. Numerous historians of the period have challenged us to reconsider this claim, which elides \"feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past\" and risks missing \"some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today\" (Enke 2018). In this course, we will begin by exploring which projects, groups, and concerns have come to define the \"second wave\" (and subsequent \"waves\") of feminism in the United States in our collective memory. We then turn to recent histories of the \"second wave,\" coupled with oral histories from movement participants, that challenge us to reconsider what counts as \"feminist politics\" during this period. For example, histories that focus on the formation of broad-based coalitions across and between liberation movements around issues of economic justice, reproductive rights, and the right to \"self-defense\" against both interpersonal and state violence during this period, challenge us to expand our conception of feminist activism. In the process, they require us to incorporate the \"critical insights and knowledges\" of labor and welfare rights activists, sex workers and gay liberationists, Black, Chicana, Puerto Rican and Indigenous liberation movement members as central to the feminist politics of the period. Guided student research into ongoing/current feminist projects (e.g. SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, Chicago Abortion Fund, Survived\u0026Punished, Critical Resistance, Sylvia Rivera Law Project) aid us in identifying the legacies of this historical period in feminist activism in 2025.",

    "overview": "From video games and board games to game shows and sports, games saturate our culture and shape who we are. Some scholars have even argued that games are replacing novels and film as the dominant form of cultural expression. Others view games as a frivolous and unproductive activity, not worthy of serious study. In this seminar, we will explore some of the fundamental questions about the relationship between games and human culture. Why do people play games? What kinds of meanings, cultural values and political agendas do games encode? Do games function differently than other cultural objects, such as films, novels or works of art? What might it mean to think of all culture and works of art as arising from a \"play impulse\"? And if this is the case, why do we trivialize game-playing? Is the ubiquity of games in our lives a specifically modern phenomenon? Is the advent of the digital age producing a gamification of everyday life? To investigate these questions, we will read a wide range of critical writing about the importance of play and games in human culture, by philosophers, novelists, literary critics, social scientists, historians and game designers. The class will give you an opportunity to develop a 12-15 page research paper that studies one particular game or aspect of game culture in-depth. In the process, you will learn how to frame a significant research question; articulate a research proposal; navigate scholarly databases and archives; evaluate sources; and, produce an annotated bibliography.",

    "overview": "Since the early days of photography African Americans have specifically engaged the medium to navigate African diasporic identity. Seminal Black thinkers such as Frederick Douglass and W. E. B. DuBois argued for photography's importance in the construction of African American identity. Organized chronologically, this course traces the shifting social status of African Americans from the 1850s to today and examines the relationship between African Americans and the medium of photography. This chronology will also help us map the rapid development of different photographic technologies over 150+ years. Putting primary sources in conversation with art historical texts, this course will introduce students to major thinkers that have contributed to African American art history including Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, Angela Davis, Deborah Willis, Shawn Michelle Smith, bell hooks, Saidiya Hartman, and Tina Campt. While focused on the intersection of African American identity and photography, we will also draw connections to the broader African diaspora. Students will have the opportunity to examine art in person at The Block Art Museum and/or the Art Institute of Chicago which each hold important key photographs related to the course topic. Through course discussion, short writing assignments, and visits to local art collections, we will explore these topics together and strengthen core art historical skills of visual literacy, analytic writing, and critical reading skills.",

We link a poem documenting silicosis in the lungs of West Virginian coal miners to a novel portraying the aftermath of the Union Carbide gas leak in Bhopal, India. We compare a nonfiction account of Kenyan women resisting deforestation and an iPhone app reclaiming public access along the Malibu coast. We explore questions of voice, genre, and narrative, cataloguing the strategies writers and artists use to reach a global audience.",

Using a variety of sources, from fiction to art, from bodily modification to textile production, from legal codes to advertisements, we will study both actual garments created and worn throughout history, as well as the ways in which they inform identity markers such as class, ethnicity, nationality, and gender. Among the topics we will analyze in this sense will be hairstyles, foot-binding, plastic surgery, and, in a deeper sense, bodily practices that inform most fashion-related discourses in East Asia. We will also think through the issue of fashion design, production, and consumption as an often-contested site of modernity, especially in relationship to the issue of globalization and world-market. Thus, we will also include a discussion of international fashion designers, along with analysis of phenomena such as sweatshops.",

In this course, students will continue developing the four skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and learn various aspects of Japanese culture and society through readings, videos, written assignments, and in-class activities.\n\nThe emphasis will be on developing the skills necessary to describe not only their own experiences and daily lives, but also their community, general trend, and what is happening in society, while increasing vocabulary and sentence structures that they can use more precisely. Students will also practice summarizing a story that they heard, read, or watched. Careful and thorough review and preparation for each class session are expected. With consistent oral and written feedback from the instructor, students will enhance their language and cultural awareness, leading to increased understanding, appreciation, and utilization of the target language, to become autonomous learners.",

Black American intellectuals have a lengthy history of debating this issue. This course considers this debate. Do African Americans have a duty to unify on the basis of race for the purpose of eradicating racial oppression? We will examine different philosophical theories relating to Black solidarity.",

The first half of the course will concentrate on state formation and the politiÂ­cal, economic and ideological forces that shaped the Peninsula until the British withdrawal. The second half of the course will be more thematic and will address some of the most important challenges that the region has faced since the 1970s. Because of its undeniable regional importance and influence, Saudi Arabia will receive particular attention throughout the quarter, though lectures and readings will cover other emirates of the Gulf as well as Yemen. The course combines lectures and some discussions.",

These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

    "overview": "The Talmud is one of the most important works of Jewish literature. For the last millennium, Talmud study has been a central part of Jewish religious and cultural practice. Despite the splintering of Judaism into different denominations, Jews the world over are unified by their commitment to studying Talmud. The Talmud is an unusual work of literature, and it has been credited as an influence on codes of law, sermons, modern works of Jewish literature, and even Seinfeld. This course will explain the Talmud's import and durability within Jewish culture while introducing students to the rigors of legal analysis that lie at the heart of most talmudic passages. The course is ideal for those interested in religion, law, logic games and questions of textual interpretation. The course will study the Talmud entirely in English translation; there is neither a language prerequisite nor an expectation of prior experience reading the Talmud.",

This course takes an expansive look at various permutations of interdependence as imagined across terrains ranging from millennia-old Buddhist texts to modern explorations into Buddhist environmentalism (ecodharma), political ecology, and critical theory. In this process, the elements that comprise our environmentâearth, water, air, minerals, trash \u0026 treasuresâwill transform from scenery to agentic forces with whom living beings act. \n\nAs we move through this pilgrimage across disciplines, we will ask ourselves: What are the consequences of understanding ourselves as individual agents, acting alone in the universe? In what ways is individualism a sought-after virtue according to some, and part and parcel of humans' earth destroying tendencies according to others? What alternative ways of being and knowing can we imagine that present human agency in relational terms, co-constituted not just by other organisms, but also by a web of environmental conditions that make life possible? How can we re-envision humans' interdependent relationship with the more-than-human world in ways that can mitigate climate grief and apathy and support sustainable living practices?\n\n*Counts toward Religion, Health, and Medicine (RHM) major concentration.",

It prepares managers to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change. This is accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics, corporate culture and strategic organizational design.\nThe goal of this course is to create, develop, and enhance your leadership skills. The course is designed to prepare you to lead high-performing, successful firms in the future and to effectively steer your own careers. These will be the twin themes of the course: (1) how to establish, manage, and lead prosperous firms and (2) how to develop a thriving career for oneself.\nA key leadership task is to assemble the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and groups into those combinations that best solve the organizational problem at hand. You must manage people, information, and processes to accomplish organizational goals. You must make things happen, often under conditions or time frames that are not of your own choosing. The successful execution of these goals requires leaders to be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence, and motivate others, manage the diversity of their personal contacts, tap into and motivate the human and social capital of organizational members, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organizational change.\nThis course prepares you to achieve these objectives. You will learn fundamental tools from the behavioral and social sciences that will improve your ability to analyze organizational dynamics and take robust action.",

However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

    "overview": "\"Sociology of Gender\"\n\nThis is a graduate seminar course that takes a broad theoretical approach to understanding gender as a social phenomenon. Sociologists who study gender primarily conceptualize gender not as only an identity or role, but as a system of practices, relations, and structures that organize people into different categories, and create, produce, and maintain inequality on the basis of perceived difference. The course begins by considering sociological theories of gender across processes that occur at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We will conceptualize how gender as a system interacts with other social structures and identities, including intersections of social class, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. We will then evaluate theoretical approaches in their application to particular empirical contexts, such as the family and workplace inequality, primarily focusing on gender difference and inequality in the United States. Students will propose an independent research project that applies the conceptual, theoretical, and analytical tools gained in the course to an empirical domain.",

In addition to the developments and debates surrounding the various historical, social, and political aspects of Latinx popular culture, we will also discuss the impact that it has had in the broader American cultural (and economic) landscape. To help us develop a critical analysis, we will read key texts on issues such as race and racism, authenticity, performance, cultural production, representation, globalization, and critical media studies.",

We will explore how and why female artistic production from the beginning of modernism, the Harlem Renaissance, and the heyday of the \"woman's picture,\" 1933-1950 featured women on the brink, rejecting the 19th -century \"marriage plot,\" for a different set of endings. We will discuss the significance of \"the New Woman,\" the last throes of the \"cult of domesticity\" and the work of arguably classic Hollywood's greatest actress, Bette Davis, whose films took up those historical issues.",

Although Tibet was a civilization characterized by a unique prominence of religious literature produced and consumed in monastic institutions, the nature of literature and literacy has changed in Tibet in the past seventy years, becoming more accessible to the wider public. Tibetan writers have used fiction and poetry in new ways to reflect on life, rapidly changing worldviews, and the significance of the past as well as the present.\n\nThis course will introduce students to a number of contemporary Tibetan literary works, mostly secular in nature, including short novels, fiction, nonfiction essays, and poetry in English translation, as well as academic studies and scholarly analysis of relevant subjects.",

    "overview": "AY 24-25 This seminar on Korean media culture examines the development of media technologies, institutions, and practices that have shaped contemporary South Korean popular culture and led to its global prominence. In a 2021 New York Times article titled \"From BTS to âSquid Game': How South Korea Became a Cultural Juggernaut,\" South Korea is described as an undeniable global soft power. However, this present success would have been difficult to imagine in the 1980s, when South Korean society largely viewed itself as a relatively \"undeveloped\" postcolonial nation, just beginning to recognize the strategic importance of its information and culture industries in the so-called age of post-industrialization. This course begins from that earlier historical moment to trace and understand the rise of South Korea's now-prominent cultural industries. A key question we will explore is the notion of national cultureâspecifically South Korean culture, which is inseparable from our critical reflection on the concept of national culture itself. In this sense, we can ask, \"What exactly is Korean about K-pop or K-drama?\" We'll examine how national culture, as a critical issue and a collective endeavor, is linked to postcolonial and Cold War-era nation-building projects, global debates on colonial legacies and U.S. cultural imperialism, and South Korea's push for globalizationâshaped in part by U.S. pressureâsince the 1990s (or the 1980s, considering earlier structural changes in economic and technological infrastructure). In addition to investigating \"Korean culture\" as a concept defined in various ways across different historical periods, the course encourages critical reflection on dichotomies such as national vs. global and East vs. West. These reflections are particularly relevant in a globalized context where the production, distribution, and consumption of K-pop and other forms of Korean media frequently transcend national boundaries, often engaging with and mediated by diasporic communities.",

Rather than reading literature and literary scholarship in isolation, we will trace their entanglements in environmental history, anthropology, philosophy, geography, and other adjacent disciplines. What, we will ask, are the unique affordances of literary study when confronting environmental questions and challenges? What are the risks and rewards of conducting interdisciplinary environmental research?\n\nThe syllabus will be tailored to support the particular interests and pursuits of students in the course, but topics may include climate writing, environmental justice literature, environmental racism, global and local scales, militarized and nuclear environments, and queer ecologies. Collectively, the readings will ensure familiarity with classic texts in the environmental humanities and introduce students to the cutting edges of this wide-ranging field.",

    "overview": "Bodies in Crisis: Illness, Transformation, and Power in Latin American Culture\n\nThis course examines the relationship between illness, the body, and power relationships in Latin American cultural production from the early 20th century to the present. Through a multidisciplinary lensâincluding literature, film, theory, and visual artâwe will explore how bodies in states of illness, disorder, and transformation reveal cultural anxieties and histories of oppression. Rather than viewing illness solely as a medical condition, we will investigate how it disrupts normative conceptions of race, gender, class, and sexuality. The course will interrogate how vulnerable, excessive, and often stigmatized bodies challenge control and order mechanisms, offering different ways of understanding identity, resistance, and human agency. By engaging with canonical and marginalized voices, we will explore ways in which the body opens spaces for new forms of resistance and meaning-making.

How did they also develop their own imagination of social justice, autonomy, and emancipation? \n\nBased on a wide range of materials and references driven by the social sciences, literature, and cinema, this course aims to introduce undergraduate students to a non-US-centered and transnational perspective on Black feminisms.

In the first quarter (Hindi-Urdu 111-1) the students are introduced to the Hindi (Devanagari) script and to aspects of Hindi-Urdu grammar. By the end of this quarter the students will be able to talk about their family, their routines, their likes and dislikes, and also describe actions in progress. In the second quarter (Hindi-Urdu 111-2), students continue to learn new grammatical constructions, and by the end of the quarter they are able to talk about events in the past and the future. In the third quarter (Hindi-Urdu 111-3), students learn to express possibilities, wants, abilities and capabilities. They also learn finer aspects of grammar. By the end of this quarter students achieve intermediate-low language skills in Hindi-Urdu.",

The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of the Divine Comedy's cantos in their cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante fashioned the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible to craft his dream of universal peace. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Comedy and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.",

    "overview": "\"Walter Benjamin's Small History of Photography\" \n\nThe course will explore the theory and history of the photographic medium taking as point of departure Benjamin's writings from the 1930s on. As he studied the revolutionary changes in perception that technology introduced, he became one of photography's most important and influential thinkers. Photography's relation to memory, the medium's relationship to the unconscious, the changes mechanical reproducibility introduced for our aesthetic experiences, the social and political significance it acquired as a way to understand modern life and how it facilitates as well as shapes social relations, as well as how it allegorizes embodied and cognitive processes through which we engage the world are reflections that stem from his now famous essay. Taking as a point of departure the essay's reflection on the first century of photography's history, and the corpus of both photographers (Atget, Renger Patzsch, Sander, Bossfeldt, Freund, Krull, Abbott) and photographer's historians it gathers, we explore both the critical vocabulary Benjamin develops around them as well its conceptual apparatus. We closely analyze the photobooks Benjamin reviews in his essay as well as the photobook phenomenon in interwar years globally. Then we move to a secondary bibliography that produced significant interpretations of Benjamin's essay: Cadava, Silverman, Didi-Hubermann, Collingwood-Selby, ZervigÃ³n, and finally we assess its oblique influence in Barthes' Camera Lucida.",

    "overview": "For the past thirty years, reality television - a genre of programming that aims to give us a view into the \"unscripted\" actions of our peers - has been a dominant force in U.S. entertainment.  Many of us watch these shows to relax, to turn off our critical thinking, and to immerse ourselves wholly into some manufactured drama and schadenfreude.  Considered as a cultural text, though, reality television can illuminate some profound truths: about how we decide what is right and wrong, about the tension between written and unwritten rules, and whether anyone can simply be \"here to make friends.\"\n \nIn this course, we ask what reality TV can teach us about the nature of law.  We'll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, Scott Shapiro, and others, and then see how their ideas stand up to the test of shows like Survivor, The Bachelor, FBoy Island, Ink Master, and Bachelor in Paradise.  By the end of the quarter, students will be able to explain the main currents of thought in legal philosophy with reference to elimination ceremonies, confessionals, alliances, and other fundamentals of reality TV gameplay.",

In the revised article, students develop an original argument relative to a significant problem or research question; demonstrate knowledge of relevant primary and secondary sources and the ability to evaluate them critically; engage with an appropriate theoretical or scholarly methodology; and draw out clearly the significance of their findings. The class meets regularly as a group for the purpose of discussion and feedback on individual work. Students submit written assignments and make short presentations on essential elements of their articles, including the argument, the current state of the secondary research, and their contribution to the field. In addition, they receive and write a reader's report similar to those generated by referees of journal submissions. Throughout the course, students will meet individually with the professor to discuss their progress in addition to working with their peers. Work written or revised over the course of the quarter will be shared and discussed in the final class meeting. This course is required for 2nd and 3rd year graduate students in French. It will be taught in English. Enrolled students must submit the seminar paper they wish to revise to the professor no later than December 18, 2024 as the professor will generate feedback on each paper before the first day of classes.",

The second half of the first quarter will discuss simple applications relevant to electrons in metals, including the effect of external fields, two-particle interactions, impurity scattering, ensemble averaging and calculations of conductivity.  At the end of the second quarter we will touch upon superfluidity in liquid helium 4.\n\nThe second quarter will be devoted to superconductivity, the development of the nonequilibrium (Keldysh) Green's function technique and the quasiclassical approximation, with specific applications in disordered superconductors.\n\nKnowledge of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics at the first- year graduate level will be assumed.  In particular, it is expected that students are familiar with second quantization.  Familiarity with topics covered in a graduate course in condensed matter physics would also be useful.",

These two quarters will, in fact, teach all the fundamentals of the language and lead students directly into second-year courses in the New Testament, classical Greek oratory, and Homeric epic.

    "overview": "Concurrent with the opening of the exhibition Project a Black Planet: The Art and Culture of Panafrica (December 15-March 30, 2025) at the Art Institute of Chicago, this course considers the cultural and political dimensions of Pan-Africanism, beginning with its origins in the late-nineteenth century and extending to the present day. Students will critically examine the process of narrating art and cultural histories through the multivalent form of the exhibition, it's catalogue, and its institutional context within an encyclopedic museum.\n\nStudents in this course will meet at the Art Institute of Chicago weekly and will engage with the exhibition as the primary case study for considering a range of questions, including: 1) How does the exhibition's layout, design, checklist, and use of media support its overall arguments about Pan-Africanism's evolution and endurance as a force in culture? 2) What other kinds of spaces, sites, or institutions have enabled attention to and the circulation of Pan-Africanist ideas? 3) How do the intersections of class, gender, race, and sexuality, shape our understanding of Pan-Africanism's influence on art and politics?\n\nThis course will consist of weekly reading assignments and a final project; discussions will be supplemented by in-class conversations with visiting artists, curators, and a range of public programs, including symposia and film screenings. Students should be prepared to travel to the museum weekly. This course will also include graduate students from the University of Chicago, and so space will be limited.",

    "overview": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners or resources. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities.",

    "overview": "What counts or does not count as \"religion\"? How do we know? And who gets to decide? This course explores the major foundational theorists in the field of Religious Studies, while placing them into conversation with contemporary perspectives in the field. We begin by asking \"What is a theory? And what does it mean to have a theory about something?\" We then dig into those theories and engage with them -- \"activating theory\" by representing each theory we study in creative and participatory ways that actively involve the whole class. Throughout the quarter, you will be formulating your own theory of religion and then making the case for it in your final project. Have you taken theory courses in the past that are a bit dry and opaque? We take a different tack. Put on your creative and artistic thinking caps as we make theories of religion come alive in unique and innovative ways. This course involves music, art, video, podcasts, and other artistic mediums, in addition to written texts.ï»¿ï»¿",

Situated within the broader debates on the nature of science from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, the course explores how modernism's preoccupation with fragmentation and alienation both reflected and challenged contemporaneous medical discourse. With a transnational approach, we will analyze medical narratives, philosophical essays, and artistic creations on topics that may include eugenics; germ theory (vaccines, discovery of antibiotics); the development of X-ray technology and the illusion of body transparency; the prominence of  syphilis and tuberculosis, the emergent medicalization of trans experiences, the rise of psychoanalysis, wartime wounds and mutilations, debates on vitalism, the higyenization of public spaces, hysteria, and the resistance posed by non-Western epistemologies of health.",

In the first three weeks we read a sample of Kafka's\nshorter writings, including \"The Judgment,\" \"The Transformation [Metamorphosis],\" \"The Stoker,\" and \"The\nHunger Gracchus.\" In the fourth week, we turn to Walter Benjamin's commemoration of Kafka on the tenth\nanniversary of his death. In the following five weeks we consider three further responses to Kafka's work from\naround the world, specifically those of Ingeborg Bachmann, J. M. Coetzee, and Han Kang. Readings are in\nEnglish, and so, too, the discussion; but the class welcomes students who can read the texts in the original\nlanguages (German, English, and Korean).",

    "overview": "1.\tConsider how another person would describe you. What are you like? How did you come to be like this? Will you always be like this? How does this influence your social interactions, and vice versa? In this class, we'll examine just this-the psychology of personality-including how it's measured and its typical and atypical development, manifestation, and expression. The broad aims of our class are to 1) compare and contrast the big theories of personality, its origins, and its consequences, 2) read empirical research to help us further evaluate the evidence supporting each theory, and 3) apply these discussions to assess the personalities of ourselves and others. Our readings, discussions, and assignments will emphasize real-world application and investigation, including the limitations of the field.",

In the first three weeks we read a sample of Kafka's shorter writings, including \"The Judgment,\" \"The Transformation [Metamorphosis],\" \"The Stoker,\" and \"The Hunger Gracchus.\"  In the fourth week, we turn to Walter Benjamin's commemoration of Kafka on the tenth anniversary of his death.  In the following five weeks we consider three further responses to Kafka's work from around the world, specifically those of Ingeborg Bachmann, J. M. Coetzee, and Han Kang. Readings are in English, and so, too, the discussion; but the class welcomes students who can read the texts in the original languages (German, English, and Korean).",

Which aspects of the human capacity for language are best understood as biological, as species-wide and species-specific? How do families, schools, and communities help shape children's development as speakers and listeners, and eventually as readers and writers? How does learning a first language (or more than one language) interact with learning to think, learning to imagine, and developing a sense of identity? To explore these questions, we will consider studies of children's language development along with perspectives from social policy, medicine, education, business and marketing, the arts and publishing. Students will have regular opportunities to reflect on their own experience, and each student will be able to select a topic of individual interest for a final seminar project.

While many data science problems can be solved using knowledge from multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R through the IDE RStudio to conduct data science. Students will be introduced to machine learning and will develop skills, tools, and strategies for modeling and understanding complex data. Methods to be addressed include linear regression and classification, tree-based models, model selection, and model assessment, resampling methods, regularization methods. These skills will be developed through project/lab based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). The skills developed in this course are necessary for STAT 301-3 Data Science 3 with R.",

    "overview": "For the past thirty years, reality television - a genre of programming that aims to give us a view into the \"unscripted\" actions of our peers - has been a dominant force in U.S. entertainment. Many of us watch these shows to relax, to turn off our critical thinking, and to immerse ourselves wholly into some manufactured drama and schadenfreude. Considered as a cultural text, though, reality television can illuminate some profound truths: about how we decide what is right and wrong, about the tension between written and unwritten rules, and whether anyone can simply be \"here to make friends.\"  In this course, we ask what reality TV can teach us about the nature of law. We'll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, Scott Shapiro, and others, and then see how their ideas stand up to the test of shows like Survivor, The Circle, and Bachelor in Paradise. By the end of the quarter, students will be able to explain the main currents of thought in legal philosophy with reference to elimination ceremonies, confessionals, alliances, and other fundamentals of reality TV gameplay.",

The first part focuses on social choice theory, or how individual preferences are aggregated to form a collective preference and determine a collective decision. The second part of the course analyzes the link between politician motivations and policy outcomes. In the last part of the course, the formal framework developed in early parts is applied to major policy issues: redistribution, pensions, and regional transfers.",

The course also provides a concise introduction to key concepts in Buddhism (with minimal discussion of the evolution of different Buddhist schools and sects) and how these ideas relate to topics from main-stream Psychology. As students work through the material, we will examine how the critical Buddhist observation of interdependence, especially of all living beings and their environment, leads to an ethical system based on the view that harming others is also harming oneself. Implications of these foundational concepts will be investigated in relation to class materials.",

    "overview": "Social stratification explores how human society gets divided into haves and have-nots. It encompasses both the unequal distribution of scarce resources and the processes through which those resources are distributed unevenly to individuals according to a wide range of social characteristics. It also explores how individuals can change their social position over time (mobility) and examines how different dimensions of social status (such as race, class, and gender) can intersect, or sometimes diverge. This class will cover sociological explanations, theories, and research on key forms of inequality in the United States. Some of the main questions we will address include: What is social stratification and how is society \"stratified\"? What do the extremes of social inequality look like? How does one climb the ranks in society? What are the social institutions that contribute to, and sometimes attenuate, inequality? What role do race and gender play in stratifying society? What are the consequences of inequality in the United States for individuals? And where do we go from here?",

We will examine the historical development of tribal governments, U.S. laws and policies governing Indigenous affairs, Indigenous legal traditions, the European doctrine of discovery, diplomatic relations, treaty-making, and the constitutional foundations of federal Indian law. In addition, we will analyze key U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the growth of federal bureaucracy in Indian Country, the expansion of tribal authority in the 20th century, and municipal interactions with Native nations. The course will address contemporary relationships between Indigenous nations, federal and state governments, and the role of federal Indian law as both a colonial tool and a mechanism for Indigenous communities to protect their interests. Throughout the course, we will explore the legal and political challenges facing American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Indigenous peoples in U.S. Territories.",

    "overview": "Being Human in a More-Than-Human World\n\nA binding principle of interrelationship weaves through domains as divergent as ecology, Buddhism, and critical theory, among others. This course takes an expansive look at various permutations of interdependence as imagined across terrains ranging from millennia-old Buddhist texts to modern explorations into Buddhist environmentalism (ecodharma), political ecology, and critical theory. In this process, the elements that comprise our environmentâearth, water, air, minerals, trash \u0026 treasuresâwill transform from scenery to agentic forces with whom living beings act.\n\nAs we move through this pilgrimage across disciplines, we will ask ourselves: What are the consequences of understanding ourselves as individual agents, acting alone in the universe? In what ways is individualism a sought-after virtue according to some, and part and parcel of humans' earth destroying tendencies according to others? What alternative ways of being and knowing can we imagine that present human agency in relational terms, co-constituted not just by other organisms, but also by a web of environmental conditions that make life possible? How can we re-envision humans' interdependent relationship with the more-than-human world in ways that can mitigate climate grief and apathy and support sustainable living practices?",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

In this course, students will explore how the afterlives of colonialism and slavery has shaped the contemporary relationships between Africans and African Americans. A host of cultural forms and expressions offer a lens for reading the political zeitgeist, alliances, contact zones, exchanges, tensions, dissonances, and modes of solidarity between Africans and African Americans. Students will explore how writers, musicians, performers, and scholars excavate the ongoing intimacies between the continent and the African diaspora, in a post-Civil Rights U.S. and postcolonial Africa. How do migration patterns, racialized economics, global geopolitics, community activism, and technologies of culture redefine these diasporic encounters? What role does the arts play in achieving social change for our communities?",

We will learn from linguistic studies which factors support or impede accuracy in listening for second language learners, including those related to the listener, the speaker(s), and the speech environment. We will address perception of sound contrasts in US English that may not be present in other world languages. Students will practice listening to rapid and/or reduced speech, speech in noisy environments, multi-speaker conversations, and to speakers of different dialects of English to build confidence and competence. Students will also learn sociolinguistic strategies for interactions in which listening may be especially challenging. Active participation and evidence of progress towards proficiency must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.",

In exploring major historiographical debates on these topics, students will be encouraged to think critically about contested visions of âBlack history' as an academic field of inquiry and as a political and social resource across the diaspora.  Likewise students will be encouraged to consider how lines of interpretation and methodological approaches to Black history have changed over time.",

They will develop key skills for academic interactions, such as making small talk, effective use of email, and formal/informal presentations. Along the way, students will learn about the sound structure of English as they work towards improved pronunciation and fluency. Students will have an opportunity to consider their own oral English proficiency in light of proficiency assessments used at Northwestern, and will receive feedback on Versant test performance and practice sessions.",

    "overview": "Afro-Brazilian Writing, Culture, and Perspectives\n\nBlack writing matters, and Afro-Brazilian authors have made indispensable contributions to the literature of the African diaspora. Brazil has the largest Afrodescendant population outside of Africa. It was the last nation in the Western hemisphere to officially abolish slavery in 1888, and it imported more enslaved human beings from the transatlantic slave trade than any other country in the world. Africans and their descendants have shaped virtually every aspect of Brazilian culture, including its literary and intellectual production. Students will thus take a critical look at Brazilian history, and society through the lens of Afro-Brazilian fiction, poetry, testimony, Black feminist theory, graphic novels, documentary, and song lyrics. By the end of the course, students will be able to name some of the most influential Afro-Brazilian authors and make meaningful connections and comparisons between their rich and multifaceted works. Students will also be able to write and talk about how Black authors have challenged racism and intersecting structures of oppression in a global context from the 19th century to the present. Students will leave the class with an appreciation for how Afro-Brazilian literature can help us not only critique society but also collectively imagine a more equitable and inclusive future for all in Brazil and beyond.",

    "overview": "The Earth and planets are composed of minerals, rocks, melts, and fluids. The study of Earth materials is fundamental to Earth and environmental sciences and deals with formation, stability, environments, and properties of materials that control large-scale processes from weathering to earthquakes. The physical properties of Earth materials are largely controlled by bonding and crystal structure. This course begins with an atomistic approach to understanding mineral properties, but also extends physical properties and mineral stability to the larger geological and planetary scales. The properties of minerals also dictate how we use them for societal applications, ranging from raw materials to chemical filters and energy sources and storage materials. Mineralogy is the application of physics, chemistry, and biology to natural materials, and this course emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of mineralogy. Students will gain skills in learning to identify the major rock-forming minerals in hand-specimen and in the optical microscope. Students will apply analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy to quantitative analysis of minerals.",

    "overview": "Bad News. That is what Americans are experiencing as a result of the corporate media mergers that took place in the closing years of the last century. Today there are six major companies that control much of what people read, hear and see. Those firms are AOL-Time Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney, News Corporation, Viacom/CBS, and Bertelsman. This course will examine the monetary forces that are driving the industry away from its primary mission of information. Critics contend that the drive for higher ratings, circulation and web page clicks is coming at the expense of the quality of news on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Charges of Fake News combined with the ever-diminishing number of news providers is threatening democracy by limiting the number of voices that can be heard in our society.",

We will move beyond the authoritative narratives that often medicalize or pathologize mourning, engaging instead with the insights of Black and Brown scholars, philosophers, activists, and artists who view mourning as a vital foundation for dissent in the quest to envision alternative futures. Our exploration will utilize a variety of texts, including journal articles, short stories, films, photographs, and exhibitions, to analyze how memory and mourning are expressed, embodied, and mobilized in shaping individual and collective forms of protest and refusal against the enduring legacies of colonial violence. Our approach will be transnational and diasporic, allowing us to explore how memory and affect are transmitted across time and space. and space.",

    "overview": "Given the gains of the Black Freedom Struggle, what accounts for the rise of #BlackLivesMatter? In this seminar we will pay close attention to the role of policing in Black communities since the 1960s. We will explore how and why police became so central to US social policy and the factors that produced an extraordinary degree of incarceration in the United States. We will consider the degree to which electoral politics have been responsive to the struggles and challenges in poor Black communities. This seminar examines urban racial conditions since the 1960s and explores the analyses, remedies and solutions that young activists have been formulating to address the challenges of the 21st century. Readings include historical and contemporary studies. A major goal of this class is to sharpen your writing skills. We will balance reading assignments with short writing assignments.",

We will read and watch a range of literary and historical sources, including the story of the Golem and writings by VÃ¡clav Havel, and Franz Kafka.",

    "overview": "\"Computational Content Analysis\"\n\nMuch of the social world is stored in digital text. Such textual traces include social media posts, email correspondences, party manifestos, blogs, novels, newspaper articles, press releases, medical records, academic articles, and much more. Not only are archival data increasingly available in electronic form, but more and more human communication and interaction occurs natively through digital text. These vast amounts of data can be a treasure trove for social science - but to make them useful for our purposes, we need natural language processing and machine learning methods. \n\nThis class offers an overview of text analytical tools currently used in social science research. You will be introduced to a set of methods and provided with examples of how they are applied to answer concrete social science research questions. Beyond surveying approaches, we will explore some of the methods ourselves, and you will learn how to use them for your own work. In this class, we will use R. Therefore, some coding experience (or exceptional motivation to attain it independently alongside the class) is expected.",

We will study and discuss the importance of qualitative data collection tools such as participant-observation, oral histories, interviewing, photo-elicitation, and writing fieldnotes. In addition to discussing the methods as technique, we will examine issues related to the practice of ethnographic research; these include but are not limited to IRB, ethics, gender, race, class, age, etc. Our discussions will be based on the assigned readings and on students' own proposed research and field experiences. The course will enable you to understand why certain methods are chosen for different kinds of research, which method(s) would be most useful in your own research, and how to draft such data collection agendas into a grant proposal. Students will work on designing their dissertation grant proposal during the quarter.",

    "overview": "Topic: American Nightmare: Race Science from the 18th C to the Present\n\nIs the American dream only a white dream, even a fantasy? Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning 2017 horror film Get Out, in which a white liberal family systematically transplants the brains of their aging family members into the bodies of Black people, satirizes the postracial fantasy of colorblindness. White wealth and flourishing (and eternal youth) are based on a horrifying techno-fix: the exploitation and extraction of Black life, the production of a living nightmare. Peele's film raises unsettling questions about the American conception of raceâquestions with deep historiesâwhich this class aims to explore: How has race been mobilized as a structure of white supremacist social control? What has racialization meant for those being racialized? Centralizing the work of Black and Indigenous thinkers, our goal will be to interrogate what race has meant in American culture over time. We will read a selection of excerpts and short texts from the 18th and 19th centuries to learn about the development of \"race science\" as a logic underpinning violently imposed social hierarchies. In tandem with this material, we will analyze Peele's film and two contemporary novels with historical roots: Colson Whitehead's The Nickel Boys (2019), the story of a young Black man in a \"reform school\" in 1960s Florida, and Tommy Orange's Wandering Stars (2024), which traces the experience of two Indigenous boys at the Carlisle Indian School, an institution designed to destroy Native culture. In doing so, we will aim to investigate the question: What are our contemporary inheritances of these histories?",

    "overview": "This course works comparatively with texts from Latin American modernismo and European traditions to elaborate on different conceptualizations of the modern imagination. Modernismo characterizes by its strategies of cultural appropriation on one side, and of cultural exhibition on the other, as it marks the moment of most intense traffic of symbolic and material goods and at the same time it claims its cultural autonomy that portrays in exhibitions, chronicles, journalism, and its poetry. Museums, world exhibitions, geographic expeditions, photography and travel writing, department stores, the fashion industry and the commodification of everyday life -what we can call an \"exhibitionary complex-\" rendered up and laid out the meaning of the modern world. Through these mechanisms the world began being represented as a framed visual display laid out for a spectator. We will explore the system of cultural appropriation and translation practiced by Latin American writers in a moment of imperial globalization and we will consider the Latin American inflexion on such topics as literature and cosmopolitism, the poetic representation of the street and metropolitan cities, the organization of urban leisure, the woman as objet d'art,  the metropolitan fascination with subaltern cultures and debates on the production and consumption of mass urban culture.

The nine weeks of this course will survey a wide range of topics, such as Buddhist ritual, cosmology, literature, philosophy, geopiety, and intellectual history. We will attend not only to the range of subject matter covered in new Buddhist Studies scholarship, but also to the methodologies and theoretical approaches favored in selected works. Through engaging in what we can call a type of \"reverse engineering process\" in which we analyze the parts that comprise the whole of recent monographs in the field of Buddhist studies, our goal will be not only to critique, but to consider how scholars have put together recent projects with an eye toward preparing students for their own research and writing. All required course readings are in English; this is a graduate seminar but motivated undergraduates with a background in Buddhist Studies courses are welcome to request permission from the professor to register.",

Retrosynthetic analysis, substructure keying, and pattern recognition, along with other methods for synthetic planning will be discussed within the context of specific case studies. Classic and modern organic reactions, including asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, will be introduced and their application in synthetic planning examined. Case studies will include the synthesis of terpenes, alkaloids, polyketides, steroids, proteins and pharmaceuticals. The end result should be that students are familiar with the important issues associated with synthesis and gain intimate knowledge of a wide variety of chemical reactions. Ultimately, when presented with a given molecule, students should be able to develop a reasonable synthesis plan based on firm ideas and reliable transformations.",

We will read classic theories of realism by Hegel, Auerbach, Barthes, LukÃ¡cs, Blumenberg, and others, as well as significant new work by contemporary critics and theorists, together with exemplary texts of nineteenth-century European realist prose fiction. The temporal focus of the class will be mid- to late-nineteenth-century Europe and the particular literary form that dominated at this time; however, we will also go beyond this to look at the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of the notion of \"realism\" itself. Special attention will be devoted to the following questions: the purpose of genre, the place of the human, the relationship between realism and reality (or the real), the elevation of the ordinary, and the possibilities and limits of representation.",

    "overview": "\"The Past \u0026 Future of the Future: How We Think About Individual and Collective Futures\"\n\nIndividually and collectively, we think about what might happen. We consider the future over a range of time-horizons, from the immediate (what will happen in the next hour) to the distant (how will things look in a century). We worry about our own individual futures (will I have a job when I graduate from Northwestern?), we worry about other peoples' futures (will my child get a job after they graduate from college?), and we worry about our collective futures (what will climate change do to our society over the next 50 years?). Frequently, we make plans for the future, either to create a future that we seek, or to avoid a future that is problematic. Public policy is often concerned with how to create better collective futures, and the tricky part is figuring out which alternatives are better than others, and for whom. Sometimes people make contingency plans, deciding what to do if something happens (for example, disaster planning). Such activity generally involves making two types of guesses: what will or could happen in the future, and what will our future preferences be about those various possibilities. In certain cases, the predictions we make are \"self-fulfilling\" in that the prediction helps to make itself come true (bank runs are a classic example). \nIn this course, we will work through a series of examples where people have thought about the future, sometimes focused on its very specific features. Prompted by weekly required readings, we will discuss these examples seminar-style in order to hone our own thinking about the future.",

    "overview": "description subject to change: \nThis course focuses on the forces shaping countries' foreign economic policies. Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national. The course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth. The last two weeks of the course are devoted to the relationship between transnational economic linkages and conflict and to the rise of new economic powerhouses (namely, China) and the possible consequences of this shift for American influence in global economic affairs.",

Films such as Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City (1945) and Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1947) have been influential for generations of filmmakers in countries as diverse as Brazil, France, India, Iran, Senegal, and the United States. This course will explore the history of neorealism and its aftermath from a transnational perspective, paying attention to the role that diversity and plurality played from the start. We will follow how the neorealist approach developed under varied geopolitical conditions and adapted itself to document and, indeed, participate in different struggles for liberation, equality, and socioeconomic justice. While reading key texts in film and cultural studies, we will watch and analyze films by renowned directors such as Charles Burnett, Jean-Luc Godard, Abbas Kiarostami, Ousmane SembÃ¨ne, and Jia Zhangke.",

The course emphasizes the rich debates that have been staged within feminisms as feminists have labored to imagine other worlds in a variety of media and contexts. Our task will be to understand how these varied feminist traditions have interrogated the same sites - marriage and family, sexuality, reproduction, the nation and the state, work, liberation, and feminism itself - in radically different ways, depending on the context and society. Why are these themes or problems the key areas that feminist theorists have focused on across time and cultural divides? How have feminists around the world imagined these spaces as both sites of oppression and potential venues for freedom and emancipation? How can you encounter, think with, and live with feminist expressions and engagements outside the classroom?",
