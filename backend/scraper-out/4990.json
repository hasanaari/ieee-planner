    "overview": "In this course, we will explore foundational philosophical theories about the nature and value of art and aesthetic experience. We will begin by examining key aesthetic experiences—such as creation, beauty, sublimity—from the perspectives of both the artist and the observer. This inquiry will lead us to reflect on the relevance of aesthetic experience in education and its broader significance in our lives.\nBuilding on this foundation, we will analyze art's ontological and political dimensions, focusing on its relationship to the world, propaganda, and technology. Throughout the course, we will engage with key figures in the history of Western philosophy who have thought rigorously about the importance of art—or subjected it to critique—including Plato, Kant, Schiller, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Benjamin, and Kristeva.",

    "overview": "In this course, we will explore a number of diverse philosophical issues, both old and new, but all still very relevant. The focus will be on exercising our ability to think critically, and on the analysis and formulation of arguments. We will begin the course by addressing issues regarding our capacity to understand the world. These include the rationality of religious belief; whether or not there are, or could be, machines that think; and the place of the mind within a scientific conception of the world. Then we will turn to issues in practical philosophy, with an emphasis on ethics. These include the objectivity—or relativity—of moral value; whether or not the rightness of action is measured by its possible consequences; and applied issues such as whether we have a duty to help those in need. We will also consider some issues in political philosophy, especially the question of what, if anything, justifies the authority of the state.",

We will explore how carefully-designed behavioral experiments and cognitive theories together can lead us to a better understanding of how the mind works.  We will also learn how these findings relate to everyday life.  Classes will consist of lectures, demonstrations, and discussion.",

    "overview": "Course Description:\nThis course provides an introduction to the field of linguistic anthropology. Drawing from ethnographic studies of culture through language use in different social settings, students will develop an understanding of how language shapes and reflects social structures, identity, and communication practices in societies. Through theoretical readings, case studies, documentaries, and practical exercises, we will analyze linguistic practices as lenses through which to investigate aspects of identity formation as well as power relations among groups in societies. We will address issues such as language standardization, language as symbolic power, linguistic nationalism and minority languages, multilingualism, language learning and socialization, \"accents,\" and more. These topics will provide grounds for understanding:\n-\tWhat is language, how it shapes the way we think and vice versa,\n-\tHow different linguistic varieties are understood to index social differences including speakers' social class, ethnicity/race, and gender\n-\tHow these perceptions about linguistic varieties reproduce inequality and other power relations.",

    "overview": "Philosophical Ideas of Freedom\n\nThe concept of freedom has, perhaps more than any other notion, shaped the political imaginary of modern society. It occupies an especially central position in U.S. political discourse. What does it mean to live in the \"land of the free\"? Is freedom an inalienable property of the individual upon which nothing should impinge, or is it something human beings create together, in ways which necessarily involve collaboration and compromise? How should we prioritize the value of freedom in relation to other values, such as fairness, prosperity, and sustainability?\nIn this class, we will investigate the philosophical stakes of questions such as these from a variety of theoretical and political standpoints. We will begin by closely reading much of the defining document of modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill's On Liberty. We will then consider various attempts to refine or challenge the liberal conception of freedom, in figures such as Isaiah Berlin, Hannah Arendt, Philip Pettit, Friedrich Hayek, Simone de Beauvoir, and Axel Honneth. Finally, we will consider the contemporary limits of liberalism and how to overcome them, as articulated by Franz Fanon, Angela Davis, Patrick Deneen, and Maeve Cooke.",

By carefully examining aesthetic depictions of the \"outlaw\" -from the American \"Cowboy\" to the Argentinian \"Gaucho\"- this course will address not only the role that these figures have played in the construction of national identities, but will also explore their potential for unsettling our conceptions of lawfulness, institutional justice, and ultimately, of the nation itself. Thus, in analyzing written and visual cultural practices that revisit the figure of the criminal, this course will explore topics such as the relationship between legal order and violence, criminality and popular justice, as well as of the (out)law and civil society. Primary readings for this course (available in their original language and in translation) will include works from Franz Kafka, J. L. Borges, Angela Davis, Mariana Enriquez, Roberto Bolaño, Jane Campion, Ariel Dorfman, Justine Triet, and others.",

    "overview": "Anthropology is the holistic consideration of the human condition, past and present. Biological anthropology is the anthropological subdiscipline that focuses on the evolution, biological variation, and adaptations of humans and their past and present relatives. In this course, we will overview biological anthropology and the fundamentals of the scientific method through principles of evolutionary theory, basic molecular biology, and genetics. We will discuss the nuances of contemporary human population biology, non-human primate sociality and behavior, as well as fossil evidence for human evolution through comparative data from non-human primate ecology. Throughout the course, particular attention will be put on exploring biological and behavioral adaptation in diverse eco-social contexts, ultimately influencing our contemporary human condition. This course counts toward the Weinberg College natural sciences distribution requirement. A scientific adventure awaits!",

    "overview": "The environment and our natural resources are scarce yet their values are quite hard to determine. Furthermore, there are a variety of problems with the incentives to use them well. Using the tools of microeconomic analysis and some econometrics, this course will define and examine \"environmental problems\" in terms of economic efficiency. We will also discuss the methods (and shortcomings of these methods) used by economists and policymakers to place dollar values on environmental amenities (since such valuations will determine what policy options are deemed \"efficient\"), such as benefit-cost analysis. Then we will apply these tools to look at a particular set of environmental problems caused by negative externalities transmitted through naturally occurring amenities, and the effects of the policies we construct in response to these problems. NOTE: This class is not open to students who have taken Economics 370: Environmental \u0026 Natural Resource Economics.",

In each class, all four skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) will be practiced, always with the goal of enhancing students' communicative competence and advancing proficiency. Various methods and forms of engagement are targeted toward meeting the needs of different learning styles in a given classroom. Classroom activities will include individual, partner, and group work and will be complemented by homework exercises. An oral interview will be given in lieu of a final exam.",

    "overview": "What makes a literary work \"philosophical\"? Why would someone choose to write a \"philosophical novel\" as opposed to a philosophical essay or treatise? What is it to read a text philosophically, and how might such a reading contrast with other modes of textual interpretation? In this class, we'll reflect on these questions by reading novels, plays, poetry, literary criticism, and philosophical essays. Central to our investigation are two great modernist novels: Marcel Proust's Swann's Way and Viriginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. We'll pay special attention to how questions about knowledge, the self, and intersubjectivity arise and are addressed in these texts. Along the way, we'll read writers like Sophocles, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Descartes, Simone Weil, Simone de Beauvoir, and Iris Murdoch.",

    "overview": "IQRA': Premodern and Modern Arabic Literary Genres (CA. 950 - 1900 CE) \n\nDescription: In the Qur'an, the first word revealed is Iqra'—\"Read.\" This class approaches reading as both an intellectual and spiritual practice. While the texts we examine may not be explicitly religious, the act of reading itself will be treated as a sacred act—one of daily engagement. \n\nWe will study key literary forms from the 10th to the 19th centuries, beginning with early genres like the Maqāmah (picaresque tales) and the Risālah (letters or epistles). We will then move into modern genres, which include the Riḥlā (travelogues) from the Naḥdah period, also known as the Arab Renaissance, and the early Arabic novel. \n\nAs we examine these works, we will explore a central challenge: translation and interpretation. Arabic literary traditions can differ greatly from Western ones, and this contrast will be a key part of our discussions. We will look at how each genre functions within its own cultural context and identify what makes it distinctively Arabic. Throughout the course, we will consider both the formal elements (like structure and style) and thematic concerns (such as satire, love, trickery, piety, and even blasphemy). These themes appear across different genres, and by studying them, we will gain insight into how they evolve and intersect over time. \n\nEven though the genres we study might seem very different on the surface, we will also discover how they overlap, revealing the fluid and interconnected nature of Arabic literature.\nBy the end of the course, you will have a deeper understanding of adab—the term used for Arabic literary culture—and will be able to analyze the key elements of each genre, identify common themes, and appreciate the complexity and richness of Arabic literary traditions throughout history.",

    "overview": "People use language to convey information. What makes a language suitable for this purpose, and how does it work? This question is at the center of the study of linguistic meaning. In this course, we will consider questions like these: How do the meanings of words like \"everyone\", \"a\", \"hit\", and \"saw\", give rise to the similarities and differences between \"Everyone saw a hit,\" \"Everyone hit a saw,\" \"A saw hit everyone\", etc.? Can we always tell for sure what a given sentence means, and does it mean the same on all occasions? Does meaning come from sentences or from a speaker's use of sentences? What are the different types of meaning (e.g., linguistic, contextual, social)? What's the place of meaning in an overall theory of language? We will explore a variety of approaches to these questions and discuss their theoretical assumptions, methodological tools, and empirical strengths and weaknesses. LING 270 satisfies the WCAS Area II (Formal Studies) Distribution Requirement and the Empirical and Deductive Reasoning Foundational Discipline (FD-EDR) Requirement.",

However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

Why would someone choose to write a \"philosophical novel\" as opposed to a philosophical essay or treatise? What is it to read a text philosophically, and how might such a reading contrast with other modes of textual interpretation? In this class, we'll reflect on these questions by reading novels, plays, poetry, literary criticism, and philosophical essays. Central to our investigation are two great modernist novels: Marcel Proust's Swann's Way and Viriginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. We'll pay special attention to how questions about knowledge, the self, and intersubjectivity arise and are addressed in these texts. Along the way, we'll read writers like Sophocles, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Descartes, Simone Weil, Simone de Beauvoir, and Iris Murdoch.",

ECON 310-1 is a course primarily for economics majors and minors, so it will emphasize the development and application of economic theory.",

    "overview": "The purpose of this course is to present an introduction to and overview of the field of psychology. The topics we will cover include psychological research methods; the biology of behavior and emotion; perception; memory; thinking and problem solving; emotion; social influences on behavior; personality; and psychological disorders. A combination of class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of psychological science. Overall, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of an online laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first¬hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

While being fundamental to Philosophy, students in a wide range of other academic disciplines—especially those considering law school—find logic, the study of good argumentation, to be useful. \nIn Elementary Logic we will examine two different logics: truth-functional logic and first-order logic. In doing so, we will learn how to use truth tabes, complete proofs and translate ordinary language arguments into a logical language in order to rigorously evaluate their validity.",

    "overview": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to the importance of identifying, understanding and analyzing critical concepts in Black Studies. In Black Studies critical concepts are useful in two ways: first, revealing the colonial-racial terms in which western societies sustain and conceal their historical forms of domination, stratification and subordination; second, in advancing explanations based on the Black experience of modernity that enable a more critical and accountable understanding of western societies. Through this course students will be introduced to a range of concepts, often used descriptively or not explained though familiar in popular discourse (e.g. ‘Blackness', ‘Abolition', ‘Anti-Slavery'). Throughout the course students will learn techniques for evaluating and applying concepts. Overall, the course will challenge students to think more analytically, critically and methodologically about role of critical concepts in Black studies research.",

The first three weeks cover aspects of general microeconomics that everyone should know, including how the market system works, how prices are determined, why shortages and surpluses occur, and basic industrial competition. Topics include: supply and demand, competition versus monopoly, comparative advantage in trade, taxation, and market failures. The last two-thirds of the class build on these tools to study the behavior of the economy as a whole, particularly in an international context. Topics include: inflation, unemployment, recessions, booms, fiscal and monetary policy, budget deficits, economic development of nations, international trade, and exchange rates.",

In the second half of the course, we will study thinkers from the 19th century until our days that have formed various critical conceptions of these classical pictures. We will consider how these critical conceptions form the basis of contemporary contestations over power that inform the changing shape of politics across the world today.",

Focusing on flashpoints in the history of LGBTQ+ rights and culture, students will leave this course with a concrete sense of the lives and contributions of queer and trans people within social justice movements. Students will have opportunities to connect their personal experiences with historical and contemporary social and political issues. Together, we will utilize a critical lens to analyze the formation and evolution of LGBTQ+ activism, with an eye toward present and future efforts for cultural and political change.",

    "overview": "Often, anthropology is talked about as the study of human culture, where it originates, how it is transmitted, how it changes. But what is \"culture\"? Rather than a universal, one-size-fits-all answer, anthropologists today seek to understand how ideas and actions interact within specific social contexts. Through a focus on ethnography, a fundamental method of our field, students will learn how to conduct research into the processes that shape the social world, emphasizing human agency in relation to sociohistorical, economic, political, and environmental forces. Students will learn about the history of the field of anthropology and scholarly approaches across the discipline today. A key feature will be to denaturalize social assumptions, reinterpreting what we might know from our own contexts as a starting point to understand others. Students will have the opportunity to practice anthropological research through ethnographic projects.",

The first theme we will consider is the physician-patient relationship: what norms and values ought to govern such a relationship, how these may conflict with one another, and how such conflicts can be resolved. The second theme of this course addresses issues that arise in the context of biotechnology, such as selective abortion, physician-assisted suicide, and neurointerventions. The final theme of this course is social justice and public health, where we will examine how interlocking systems of oppression influence access to and quality of care, medicalization of various human conditions, and categorization of what counts as a treatable condition. No prior experience with ethical theory is expected or required.",

    "overview": "This is an introductory course that covers the fundamentals of microeconomics. We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

In this course, students will learn how archaeologists investigate the past, study the foundations of archaeological methods and theories, and uncover how these methods and theories shape interpretations of human culture. By engaging with case studies ranging from early human ancestors, ancient civilizations, historical connections, and modern archaeological movements, students will learn to understand and interpret a range of archaeological datasets. Other topics may include the history of archaeology, archaeological careers, and the impact of archaeological research on contemporary issues, with a special focus on local and Indigenous knowledge and scholarship. \nThis course will consist of lectures and class discussions. Students will be assessed through research-based and creative projects as well as weekly discussion board posts.",

    "overview": "New Topic: Sex in the Postcolony\n\nSex in the Postcolony\nCourse Description: This course will explore how literary writers and scholars have not only identified the collusion of colonial and patriarchal structures to foreground the oppression of gendered subjects but also offered sex and sexuality as a methodological tool for destabilizing relations across racial, national, and religious identities. Our readings will primarily consist of translated and anglophone short stories and novels as well as films and documentaries that delve into issues of embodiment, labour, kinship, desire, and queerness across diverse geographies, including colonial, modern, and contemporary South Asia, the Caribbean, and Britain. We will ask: how do we appreciate the silences and textures of \"third-world women's writing\" without reifying categories such as the \"third-world\" and \"women\" in the first place? What are the pitfalls and potentialities of thinking about a transnational or multicultural feminist politics in times of neoliberal precarity and rising authoritarianism? Can we envision a politics of sexual desire, queerness, or pleasure that undoes identitarian formations, instead of settling for a short-sighted politics of inclusivity? We will develop a critical framework for closely reading our texts by drawing from scholars in postcolonial, psychoanalytic, and queer theoretical schools such as Gayatri Spivak, Saidiya Hartman, Ranjana Khanna, Gayatri Gopinath, and Ann McClintock, among others. Writers, novelists, and filmmakers might include Jean Rhys, Bapsi Sidhwa, Ismat Chughtai, Shyam Selvadurai, Mahasweta Devi, Mira Nair, Shohini Ghosh, and Bernardine Evaristo. Students will be expected to submit short response-papers based on our primary readings and viewings.",

As one of the founders of the Law and Societymovement observed, \"law is too important to leave to lawyers.\"Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical,disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology,history, anthropology, political science, and critical studies) in order toexplore the sociology of law and law's role primarily in the Americancontext. The thematic topics to be discussed include law and socialcontrol; law's role in social change; and law's capacity to reach intocomplex social relations and intervene in existing normativeinstitutions and organizational structures.  \n\nCross-listed with Sociology 206-0",

    "overview": "Taking inspiration from Britney Spears's 2013 hit song, this course will challenge you to strengthen academic reading and writing skills, while asking questions about the relationship between gender and labor. Together, we will examine depictions of \"women's work\" in essays, short stories, song lyrics and television and analyze how various representations of female labor - in the home, the office, and beyond - shape cultural norms and narratives. From mothers and caretakers, to \"girlbosses\" and \"tradwives,\" this class will ask you to critically think and write about how our expectations around gender and work have changed over time. How do different conceptions of female labor intersect with race and class? Where and how do women find meaning in their work?
