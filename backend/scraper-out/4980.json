    "overview": "This course aims to extend critiques of property through close readings and discussions of foundational and contemporary readings. We especially attend to the workings of demarcation: how lines get drawn on bodies and things in ways that make property possible. Entities ranging from land to airwaves to genes can become property once they are delimited and defined as discrete objects. We will investigate how processes of demarcation produce material objects, such as land, while simultaneously producing specific kinds of (often racialized, gendered, sexual, and classed) subjects, as lines are drawn marking and de-marking material and social boundaries, objects in landscapes, legal interests and ownability, human and more-than-human subjects, and spaces of inhabitation and violence. We further examine the varying frameworks and concepts scholars deploy to address the contemporary decolonial and environmental stakes of property, the wide array of ethnographic contexts for research, and possible ways forward considering current and longstanding challenges.",

This course focuses on the theory and application of genomic technologies that can be applied across the tree of life. Linux command line and programming basics as well as data and code management best practices will be covered. Labs will train students how to use proper techniques with real data to avoid common pitfalls. In-class problems, hack-a-thons, and a final team project will enable students to apply the methods learned to their own questions in genomics.

    "overview": "An introduction to French culture through study and analysis of major themes, issues, and debates that characterize or preoccupy contemporary French thought and society, this course helps students understand French society and culture in today's world. We explore the challenges posed to the traditional republican notion of French national identity by colonial history, decolonization, immigration, and globalization by studying a wide range of documents, texts, and films that portray individual and collective experiences. Drawing on the notion of \"la France en mutation / changing France,\" we study how historical events and French institutions (especially the state and the school) shape identities. Students gain an understanding of questions relating to social inequalities and diversities from a \"French Global\" perspective, while focusing on French definitions and experiences of (in)equality and diversity, and how these play out in terms of race and ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation. Conducted entirely in French, this course is designed to increase students' ability to speak, read, and write in French, and improve their aural comprehension. Students also learn techniques of close reading and detailed critical analysis through class discussion and presentations, the creative/reflective assignment, and the analytical essay.",

This is a relatively new field of science that transcends the areas of chemistry, biology, medicine, and drug discovery. The major dogma in this field is to use principles of chemistry to provide answers to fundamental questions in biology and advance human medicine. Particular emphasis in this field is placed on designing chemical probes and chemical reactions and use those molecules/reactions to study basic biological processes. This course is suited for graduate students and undergraduate students majoring in chemistry, chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering, and biology.",

It begins by explaining what International Political Economy (IPE) is and how it differs from international economics. We'll then discuss the factors that influence international cooperation when national economic policies affect other countries. The course will also cover the politics of international trade, monetary systems, and financial structures. After that, we'll look at economic development strategies used by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign aid in supporting growth. Finally, we'll explore how global economic connections relate to political conflicts and examine the rise of new economic powers and its potential impact on U.S. influence in the global economy.",

    "overview": "The transition from the Medieval to the Modern era in philosophy began, roughly, in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and ended, again roughly, in the late 18th century. New methods of acquiring knowledge, along with a radically different conception of the world, permanently transformed the philosophical enterprise and the broader culture. In this course we will examine the views of some of the most important modern philosophers—especially Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, Leibniz, Bayle, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Du Châtelet—on the nature of God, causation, substance, mind, knowledge, and the material world. Additional readings will be drawn from Elizabeth, Galileo, Masham, Boyle, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Shepherd, and Cordova.",

We will consider the bilateral Sino-American relationship in its larger global context and in connection to the issues of war, diplomacy, commerce, race, gender, religion, and material and popular culture. Special consideration will be given to the Southeast Asia region, where so many of the problems confronting China and the US have unfolded.

This class has two goals—first, providing an overview of literature written by Asian Americans in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries and placing these texts in conversation with key concepts from Asian American culture and history. Second, interrogating the constructed, pan-ethnic nature of Asian American identity, a category that came into use only in the 1960s as a coalitional entity defined by shared histories of labor, discrimination, and national and cultural unbelonging.",

Among the topics explored are the history of the idea of the \"Middle East\" and the multiple meanings of \"modernity\" in that context; the complex relations between the Middle East and the West; the historical formation of Middle East nation-states, polities, ideologies, identities, and economies; and the dynamic struggles unfolding in the region since the 2011 uprisings.

    "overview": "Medicinal Chemistry: This is a survey course designed to show how organic chemistry plays a major role in the design, development, and action of drugs. Although concepts of biology, biochemistry, pharmacy, physiology, and pharmacology will be discussed, it is principally an organic chemistry course with the emphasis on physical interactions and chemical reactions and their mechanisms as applied to biological systems. We will see how drugs are discovered and developed; how they get to their site of action; what happens when they reach the site of action in their interaction with receptors, enzymes, and DNA; how resistance occurs; how the body gets rid of drugs, and what a medicinal chemist can do to avoid having the body eliminate them before they have produced their desired effect. The approaches discussed are those used in the pharmaceutical industry and elsewhere for the discovery of new drugs.",

    "overview": "Fierce rivalries. Raging jealousies. Misplaced desires. Unequal affections. Love triangles have long been one of the most popular tropes in fiction. In this course, we will explore how triangulated love affairs mediate channels of desire. While love triangles may seem immediately legible as a conventional structure of the heterosexual marriage plot, things are not necessarily what they seem. From cases of mistaken identity to specters of missed opportunities, what happens when desire gets oriented, misdirected, or redirected in different ways? If love triangles seem to position the third person as antagonist, then what happens when the third person instead becomes a vector through which the other two characters may express their mutual desire? We will consider the queer undertones (or, in some cases, overtones) of triangulated relations and the ways in which love triangles often open up alternative narrative trajectories that make us consider what might have been or what could be. By attending to love triangles (and the occasional rectangle or pentagon), we will consider the dynamics of gender, sexuality, and race. Possible texts include Shakespeare, Twelfth Night (1602), Austen, Sense and Sensibility (1811), Bronte Wuthering Heights (1847), Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), du Maurier, Rebecca (1938). Possible films and shows include She's the Man (2006), Past Lives (2023), and selected episodes of Bridgerton (2020).",

    "overview": "Since its inception, Israeli society is comprised of various and different social groups; immigrants, Arabs, Jews, foreign workers, religious people, secular people, ultra-orthodox Jews, Christians, to name several. In a society where many feel themselves as outsiders, how do social norms apply and is there actually something such as \"social norms\"? Or perhaps there are social norms within each group of \"others\"? What happens when social norms of a certain group clash with what is supposedly the social norms of \"Israeli society\"? And is there an actual entity of \"Israeli society\" or is it only imagined by those who seek to be part of it? Film in its nature is an introspective tool, and in the case of Israeli film it has always been a prism through which Israeli directors examine questions of identity, the treatment of \"others\", and the relationship between the center and the margins. In this class we will watch various Israeli films that relate to the notion of otherness and to the dilemmas that arise from the characters' complex position in Israeli society. Among the movies we will watch are \"Borrowed Identity\", \"The Matchmaker\", \"Sandstorm\" and \"Baba Joon\". We will read texts that will contextualize the movies and will shed light on the stance of otherness in Israeli society. No previous knowledge of Hebrew or Israel or Israeli cinema is required. All the movies will have English subtitles and all the readings will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions.",

Hoffmann's work, to Friedrich Nietzsche's comparison of beer to Christianity. Local experts will be invited to speak to the class, and we will learn about the science of brewing by focusing on the different beer styles and brewing techniques used by German brew-masters and tavern owners from the Middle Ages to the present day. A beer tasting of non-alcoholic malted beverages will be included as part of the curriculum, as well as a tour of a local Chicago brewery.",

    "overview": "Over the last decade, posters announcing \"Refugees Welcome Here\" have appeared across the American landscape. The post-9/11 era has seen the displacement of 38 million people over the Middle East and North Africa due to the ever-escalating effects of US militarism, not to mention the thousands of civilians who have died in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Palestine, and surrounding regions. Against the backdrop of what Afghan anthropologist Anila Daulatzai calls \"serial war,\" what does the figure of the refugee tell us about the status of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries? In other words, what are human rights and why do we care about them? Who gets to be a human and who doesn't? Beginning with fiction from the mid-to-late twentieth century, this course examines the dialectical logic of dispensation and denial of human rights through literary texts across nations and genres. We will employ the lens of political theory around race, citizenship, territory, and the category of the human across global sites like Kashmir, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Palestine, Mexico as well as detention sites like Guantánamo, and Manus Island. The course problematizes an investment in the rhetoric sympathy and sentiment to unlearn what Didder Fassin calls \"humanitarian imperialism,\" instead asking what it means for human rights subjects to make demands, rather than petitions, for  protection from torture, genocide, and extralegal violence. We will read fictional as well as nonfictional accounts by global authors to consider key figures such as the refugee, the undocumented migrant, the detainee, and the animal as instantiations of what Giorgio Agamben calls \"homo sacer,\" i.e. the human who remains outside of a polity as a sacrificial surrogate against the safe haven of the settler/citizen within. Students will be introduced to scholars working in the intersections of political theory, human rights, and literary studies such as Judith Butler, Joseph Slaughter, Achille Mbembe, Sonali Thakkar, and others.",

    "overview": "In this seminar, we will explore the concept of the classical Hollywood Diva by studying the films of actresses working during the Golden Age of Cinema, 1930-1950.  Our divas include Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Hattie McDaniel, Barbara Stanwyck, Theresa Harris and beyond. At least one of each of these women's films appears on our Course Reserves list and will form our objects of study for the seminar.  Several of the films feature two of our actresses performing together. After choosing an actress as your focus, you will be asked to begin research in five areas: star biography; industry history  (how Hollywood was created; the classical era; modes of production; the studio system); historical studies of the Great Depression and Roosevelt's commitment to WWII;  primary source documents (contemporaneous film reviews and artifacts from fan mail and clubs, often run out of the studio ); and film criticism from 1950-the present.  This work will culminate in a 12-15 page research paper in which you argue for your diva's transformational significance in feminist film history.",

    "overview": "Around 1720 a new style of art and architecture emerged amidst the highest echelons of the Parisian aristocratic elite: the Rococo. Characterized by gilt interiors, ornamental curves, and pastel colors, the Rococo infiltrated all forms of art making, from architecture, to painting, sculpture, porcelain, and even fashion. The style was immediately ridiculed for being overtly feminine, frivolous, and excessively luxurious. Associated intimately with the doomed queen of France, Marie Antoinette, the rococo is often cited as a direct cause of the French Revolution that would take France (and Europe) by storm in 1789.\n\nIn this course we will study Rococo art, from its origins in the sixteenth century to its fall from popularity circa 1785. By unpacking both the Rococo's bad reputation and socio-political importance, we will explore how the style was both gendered and racialized. How did Rococo art challenge dominant heteronormative aesthetic practices? How did it establish and fetishize a culture of whiteness in direct opposition to a growing colonial plantation system across the Atlantic? Throughout the quarter we will cover a variety of artforms (painting, sculpture, the decorative arts, and architecture) through the lives of key female patrons—including the infamous Marie Antoinette and lesser-known art historical \"influencers\" such as Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry. Focusing primarily in France, this course will also look at iterations of and reactions to the Rococo in Germany, Italy, and England.",

Drawing on readings across cultural theory and the environmental humanities, this course examines the ways visual media of oceans, lakes, and rivers narrate histories of technology, industry, nature, and social difference. Together we'll survey such topics as Jacques Cousteau's deep-sea filmmaking, cinematic narratives of dams and hydropower, and the representation of fictional underwater creatures, both fearsome and friendly. We'll ask: How does water relate to theories of cinematic landscape? How has water inspired new forms of vision? What different purposes can these aquatic films serve in our era of ecological concern? Students will engage with a range of narrative, documentary, and experimental films to develop a broad understanding of water's history as a vital resource, a geography of exploration and exploitation, and a source of aesthetic pleasure and symbolic meaning.",

    "overview": "Course title: Foreign Aid and the U.S. Foreign Policy\n\nThis course will examine international development aid as an instrument of foreign policy. It will focus on the role of aid in five main periods of U.S. foreign policy: 1) the Marshall Plan and the struggle for Europe (1945-1961), 2) superpower competition in the developing world (1961-1989), 3) aiding the transition to democratic governance (1989-present), 4) countering violent religious extremism in the Islamic world (2001-present), and 5) meeting the challenge of globalization (present day). \n\nWe will look at how development aid emerged as a response to the superpower competition of the Cold War. The world's first major aid package, the Marshall Plan, was a key component in the U.S. strategy of containment: it was designed to prevent further Soviet encroachment into Central and Western Europe. With success of the Marshall Plan in Europe, Washington adopted foreign as a tool to contain the spread of Communism elsewhere, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n\nWith the end of the Cold War, the focus of development aid changed to reflect Washington's evolving strategic priorities. The collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe led to the danger of conflict and instability there, and presented the U.S. with the new challenge of aiding the newly independent states with their transition to democracy and the market economy. Congress responded with the Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) Act for Eastern Europe, and the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) in the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe attack of September 11, 2001 awoke Washington to the danger of violent Islamic extremism. As in 1989, Congress responded to the need to counter this phenomenon with new aid packages. In this section of the course, we will focus primarily on efforts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, both during and after U.S. military action there.\n\nFinally, we will conclude by looking at how the challenges of globalization, particularly climate change and emerging health threats, are shaping today's foreign aid strategies. In the final week, students will present their ideas for future directions for foreign aid, in the form a briefing on their final project -- a set of recommendations on development policy for a hypothetical President.",

    "overview": "This course introduces students to documentary filmmaking as a form of cultural production. It is structured around hands-on assignments and classroom exercises, allowing students to engage directly with questions of representation, ethics, positionality, knowledge production, voice, and ownership. In addition to the hands-on experience, students will supplement their learning with readings, film critiques, film screenings, writing assignments, guest speakers, and discussions. We will explore the critical interventions Latina/o and Latin American filmmakers make through visual storytelling and the inspirations driving their work. Students will apply and expand their learning by working in small groups to produce a short film as their final project. They will learn how to operate a video camera, sound and lighting equipment, editing software, and manage production workflows and story structuring. Participation in this class requires a high level of self-motivation and organization.\n\nIn April, we will attend a screening at the Chicago Latino Film Festival as a class. This is in addition to our regularly scheduled class. Attendance at the film festival is mandatory.",

    "overview": "From abstinence-only sex education programs to the public response to songs like WAP by Cardi B \u0026 Megan thee Stallion, we are bombarded with messaging that sexuality is stigmatized. But why is sexuality so taboo? How do social forces shape the way we view, experience, and regulate sexuality? Using a sociological lens, this course explores the intersection of sexuality and stigma. We will begin by exploring foundational theories of both stigma and sexuality in the social sciences. Armed with these frameworks, we will then engage with in-depth case studies of different stigmatized sexualities, including homosexuality \u0026 bisexuality, asexuality, HIV/AIDS, infidelity, sex work, kink, ethical non-monogamy, and disabled sexualities. The course will empower students to interrogate their own assumptions and to critically examine the forces that perpetuate sexual inequality in society. By the end of the course, students will have gained a deeper understanding of how stigma operates at both the individual and structural level. The final assignment requires students to write a proposal for a research project that would answer a sociological question of their choice about stigma and sexuality.",

    "overview": "Rock deformation governs many geological processes that shape the history and the future of terrestrial planets, including mantle convection, plate tectonics, earthquake cycles, volcanism, etc. Physics of rock deformation involves generation and motion of crystalline defects in minerals, such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries. This course provides an interdisciplinary treatment of the science of deformation of solid Earth with an emphasis on the materials science (microscopic) approach. We cover mechanical behavior over various time-scales, including the elastic, anelastic (viscoelastic), and plastic response, in addition to the applications of these results to important geological and geophysical problems. Special attention is given to high-temperature creep of olivine, the main constituent of the lithosphere and upper mantle. \n\nNo previous knowledge of geology/geophysics or of materials science is assumed. The basics of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics are presented as far as they are relevant to the main topics of the course.",

While studying the language, students will be introduced to Italy and its people and they will gain both language and cultural competence. At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs. This course is the second in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. Students with some experience in Italian may take the online placement test to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence.\n\nPlease note that Tuesday classes will be asynchronous.",

    "overview": "The event of the French Revolution is one of the formative experiences for Romantic poetry. The poets often imagine themselves to be responding to the revolution, either sympathetically or critically. At the level of literary form, the many innovative poetic projects of the period are often conceived in revolutionary terms, even when they have a complex relation to political revolution. Much romantic poetry hopes to achieve a far-reaching transformation of the psyche, in the way that the French revolution had transformed the political world. In this class, we will study a wide array of writers from the romantic period, through the lens of revolution. What is revolutionary about Romantic poetry, and how is it shaped by the historical experience of revolution? In what way are romantic writers responding to the advent of modernity? What is the relationship between literature and politics, both at the level of form and content? Does it make sense to think of Romanticism as the first of the modern literary avant-gardes? Authors we will read include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Burke, Wollstonecraft, Godwin, Rousseau, Hazlitt, Paine and Schiller.",

    "overview": "AY25 In August 1947, colonial India was divided into the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan. At the same moment as former colonial subjects celebrated their liberation, millions of people experienced, and perpetrated, violence and terror on a cataclysmic scale. As the strife of Partition continued to reverberate, the following years saw extremes of idealism, cynicism, invention, and ambition. In this course, we will examine the literature and culture of the decades after 1947, as the namesake children of Salman Rushdie's famous novel grew up in their new postcolonial nations.\n\nIn addition to reading Rushdie's Midnight's Children, we will spend time with a variety of literary and artistic works, including fiction, poetry, films, plays, and paintings. Secondary works by scholars in a variety of fields will help us get below the surface and to consider a variety of ways to think about themes including democracy, conflict, gender, literary and artistic modernism, and the postcolonial condition.",

We will develop these skills through an introduction to game studies--the academic study of video games--and the genre of the Japanese role-playing game (JRPG).",

It covers basic topics such as macromolecular structure and function of biologically relevant macromolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids), membrane structure, membrane transport, signal transduction, chemical logic in metabolic transformations, carbohydrate metabolism, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. The course strongly emphasizes conceptual understanding and offers extensive student-teacher interaction. Active participation in all course elements is encouraged and advantageous as students are expected to move past memorization of facts to a fully interconnected and integrated understanding that allows students to apply their knowledge to solve complex problems. This course will equip students preparing for the MCAT and upper level biochemistry courses. Quizzes (30 minutes) are held during the Wednesday 7-8:50pm discussion section for Biol_Sci 301. The first exam is scheduled for Wed. April 30th from 7-9pm. If another class conflicts with a Biol_Sci 301 quizzes and exams, we do not offer an alternate time. The lowest score of the six quizzes will be automatically dropped.",

    "overview": "\"Science in crisis?\"\n\nWhy, in moments of crisis, do some people distrust scientific experts while others embrace them? This course will begin to answer this question in three steps: First, we will unpack the tools that experts use to assert their authority and produce a binding perception of reality. Then, we will consider the way that social movements—including \"citizen scientists,\" HIV/AIDS activists, and \"biohackers\"—contest, mistrust, or reaffirm experts' authority. Finally, we will study how these disputes are shaped by regulatory bureaucracies and the legal system. Throughout the course, students will apply concepts from the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies (STS) to current \"crises\" that hinge on scientific expertise like climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rise of artificial intelligence.",

    "overview": "The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to the history and historiography of race and gender during the Holocaust. As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.",

    "overview": "Course title: Mediating Religion\t\n\nThis seminar is an inquiry into how we experience religion in the world today. It takes seriously the idea of religion as mediated phenomena. We experience the religious through an engagement with multiple sensorial forms—things seen, felt, tasted, heard, and smelt. These can include a wide set of media ranging from YouTube videos of preachers to calendars with images of Hindu deities sold in bazars; mechanized prayer counters to the corporeal remains of venerated figures; food distributed in Hindu temples, Muslim shrines, Christian churches and Sikh gurdwaras to water brought back from pilgrimage to holy sites; Gregorian chants to Muslim calls to prayer; incense lit to commemorate the dead to camphor burnt before the image of the divine. The spaces in which we experience these religious phenomena are ever broadening as well. We do not experience the religious in places of worship alone but also at museums and in public buildings, on superhighways and in cyberspace. While this seminar adopts the perspective of religious materiality, with its concern for aesthetics, presence, memory, and space, it does not require previous knowledge of specific theories or familiarity with any particular religious tradition. It invites students specializing in different traditions and frameworks to engage with scholarship on religion and media in the hope that it offers a fresh perspective on their own materials.",

    "overview": "Toward an Aesthetics of Singularity: Kant's Critique\nIn a famous note to the first section of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Kant remarks that \"only the Germans\" persist in associating the notion of \"aesthetics\" with the \"criticism of taste.\" He argues that this is based on the \"false hope […] of bringing the judgment of the beautiful under rational principles. […] It would be advisable, therefore, to drop the name in that sense […]\" Scarcely ten years later, in his Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant grudgingly revises his view and seeks precisely to construe \"the faculty of taste (Geschmacksvermögen) as an aesthetic power of judgment\" from a \"transcendental point of view\" (in transzendentaler Absicht). In so doing, Kant acknowledges that the major challenge to defining a transcendental principle of aesthetic judgment consists in its \"immediate relation [to] feelings of pleasure and displeasure.\" How the immediacy of this relation might derive from a principle that is neither psychological nor empirical, but transcendental and a priori, constitutes the enigma -- \"das Rätselhafte\" - that his Critique seeks to resolve.\n\nBut Kant had no illusions concerning \"the great difficulty involved in resolving a problem that nature has rendered so complex (verwickelt hat).\" I suggest that nothing less is involved in this \"complexity\" than the task of rethinking the way singularities - events that don't conform to established general schemes - can be communicated and shared. Which is to say, encountered and experienced collectively. The seminar will retrace the contours and trajectory of Kant's response to this encounter with the singular, through a close reading of the first part of Kant's Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment. In the process, the interdependence of knowing and feeling will be reexamined in relation to a notion that plays no obvious role in Kant's lexicon (although it will later for Freud), namely, tension.",

    "overview": "In 1348 perhaps a third to one half of all Europeans died from a mysterious illness called the Black Death, which was only one of a number of calamities that disrupted normal life.  In the wake of these disasters, thinkers, artists, and a surprising number of common people began to search for explanations for what had gone wrong by asking questions about their own personal identities, about the obligations of a moral life, about the virtues of civic service, and about the their personal relationship with God.  This course explores that search, which is what we now call the Renaissance.  It began among the independent city-states of Italy, particularly Florence and Venice, and spread from them to the rest of Europe.\n     The course will compare developments in Italy with those in northern Europe, especially on the political and family structures of the city-states, the culture of the princely courts, the ambitions of the Roman popes, the social and intellectual basis for artistic creativity, the origins of modern political thought and the scientific method, and the constraints and opportunities available to women.",

This knowledge base provides the foundation to understand decarbonization. Because most decarbonization strategies target different aspects of the carbon cycle, the core content of the course will review the geochemistry of carbon on land, in the lithosphere, and in the atmosphere, oceans, and other waters. This background will prepare students for a series of guest lectures from alumni of the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences (currently employed in decarbonization start-ups and government agencies) that will present the most recent advances in decarbonization  being investigated and/or implemented in the U.S. and abroad.",

Students start the year by working on reinforcing all the language skills attained the year before, and adding the Nastaliq (Urdu) script to their skill set. They continue developing speaking skills and listening comprehension, as well as expanding the Hindi-Urdu grammar and vocabulary. We do so by reading short stories, poems, and articles, watching and discussing movie clips, short films and videos, and making in-class presentations. During the year we touch on a variety of themes involving South Asian culture and society, travel, literary traditions, the natural world, etc. By the end of the three-quarter sequence, students attain intermediate-mid or higher language proficiency in Hindi-Urdu.\n\nNote: Please purchase all the required textbooks in the fall quarter, as this is the only quarter that they are ordered during the year.",

    "overview": "In contrast to prevailing stereotypes of nomads as improvised, marginal wanderers or their romanticized depiction as exemplifying a simpler way of life, pastoral nomadic societies had a decisive role in shaping global history. From the late second millennium BCE to the eighteenth century CE, pastoral nomads emerged, often from the fringes of Eurasian civilizations, and wielding substantial military force influenced sedentary states, empires, and societies, from China to the Middle East and Europe. Beyond their military prowess, however, they also functioned as cultural agents. Sedentary people - Chinese, European, Muslim or others - portrayed them as violent intruders negatively impacting their cultures; yet nomads also facilitated and directed the exchange of goods, people, animals, religions, ideas, and technologies across civilizational boundaries, and maintained a relationship of interdependence with their settled neighbors. This course offers a comparative perspective on the role nomadic societies had in world history, spanning the early nomadic empire of the Xiongnu in nowadays Mongolia, Chinggis Khan's universal empire, the Berber Arabs of North Africa, and the Turkish armies in Asia Minor. We will explore how modern historians navigate the paucity of sources about nomads and the polities they established, and untangle narratives predominantly crafted by members of the sedentary societies.",

    "overview": "When Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he turned the international order upside down, initiated the largest war in Europe in over half a century, and set the stage for Russia's return to totalitarianism. How did this catastrophic turn of events come to be, and what will happen next? This course analyzes the political, economic, and foreign policy upheavals that shook Russia and Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Through the lens of the Russian and Ukrainian experiences, we will examine key concepts in comparative politics, such as revolution, regime change, market formation, nationalism, and state building. We will also consider key international relations debates pertaining to NATO enlargement, Russian imperialism, and other topics essential to understanding Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing geopolitical crisis it unleashed.",

In this seminar, we explore several 1970s-era projects in Chicago and beyond that exemplify a coalitional feminist politics and consider the usefulness of this history in an increasingly polarized present. We will read histories of this period and memoirs by movement participants, but our focus will be on engaging in collective archival research and, ultimately curating collections of (10-12) documents that aid us in recuperating these instances of successful coalition building across movements, as well as the intersectional politics that informed these collaborative projects. The seminar will introduce students to the practice of archival research as well as the remarkable range of archival materials housed in Special Collections, which might form the basis for research projects during your four years at Northwestern. Our final class project will be to collectively curate an online exhibition of our findings. Over the course of the quarter, we will also host several class visitors to explore current coalitions and projects that build on this legacy.\n\nCases include: Gay liberation and lesbian/feminism in Chicago; Chicago's \"Rainbow Coalition\" and the People's Revolutionary Constitutional Convention; Welfare rights and the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO); Reproductive rights: Clergy Consultation Service and the Jane Collective; Chicago free clinics/health projects: Black Panther Party, Young Lords Organization, Rising Up Angry, Chicago Women's Liberation Union \u0026 Chicago Women's Health Center.",

    "overview": "This course explores the history of abolitionist movements as articulated by black radicals, imprisoned intellectuals, activists, and organizers, with a focus on the mid-20th century, the Black Power Movement, and the contemporary era. While the 2020 police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor ignited calls to \"Defund the Police\" and interest in prison abolition, these demands are deeply rooted in a longer historical trajectory. The first half of this course traces the early seeds of abolition, examining foundational abolitionist ideas and the ways policing and mass incarceration became tools of the state to suppress black freedom movements and oppress those most vulnerable to white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism. The second half centers on contemporary abolitionist thought, writing, and organizing, exploring ongoing efforts to dismantle the carceral state and reimagine society. Throughout, the course highlights that carceral state abolition has always been grounded in intersectional analyses of power, identifying carceral institutions as reflections of broader systems of oppression. It also emphasizes abolition's vision of freedom and liberation from these systems, alongside the creation of a new society rooted in transforming oppressive systems and the ways that we relate to one another.",

In this course, you will learn to use two major computational tools for exploring the microbiome and its interactions with the human body. After a brief introduction to sample processing for DNA sequencing, we will use QIIME2 to describe microbiome composition and HUMANn4 to describe microbiome functional potential. Foundational microbiome research focused mainly on the gut will be discussed throughout the course, and the final product of the course will be a meta-analysis of publicly available microbiome data.",

The purpose of this course is to enlarge the students' vocabulary, and to reinforce and expand their knowledge of Hebrew grammar, as well as to deepen their knowledge of Israeli culture. Class will consist of interactive exercises for the intermediate learner, readings of a level-appropriate difficulty with more information on Israeli daily life and reality and listening to form of songs and clips in Hebrew. In Hebrew 121-3, taught in the Spring quarter,  we will expand our knowledge of past tense verbs to forms of פעל שלמים (לכתוב, לאכול, לרקוד) and פעל ל\"ה (לרצות, לעשות) andפיעל (לדבר, לספר) and הפעיל (להזמין, להרגיש)and התפעל (להתרגש, להתלבש). This variety of forms will allow us to develop our self-expression and to include writing and conversations about childhood memories, everyday situations like a visit to the doctor, volunteering in organizations, and more. We will learn more prepositions and their conjugations (like שלי, שלך) and more useful grammar structures like צריך, יכול, אפשר. We will have a fun unit about family and childhood (prepare your pictures!) and we will also learn about the Jerusalemite Zoo. As always, grammar and new vocabulary will be woven into the content.",

Latin American Literature and Revolution\n\nThis course explores how some Latin American writers and artists discussed ways of inhabiting social space during times of political intensity. Their proposals will be examined as tools to reflect on and confront the limits of historical demands, and to highlight a different desire for the political canon. The course's premise suggests that historical contexts are insufficient to explain the behavior of works of art, which can construct a different kind of experience within the prevalent politics climate. Topics such as community (and discomfort within the community), the construction of the national subject, and the politicization of existence will be addressed. The course will explore the debate on literature and revolution during the second half of 20th-century Latin America. The analysis will focus on Cuba, particularly after 1959, the year of the Cuban Revolution's triumph, as an epicenter that spread revolutionary ideas which ignited movements throughout Latin America. Special attention will be given to the process of politicization of life during the height of the revolution and the development of revolutionary order. Literary texts (as well as films and performances) will be examined to explore the impact of the revolution on these works and how writers and artists responded to the new political landscape. We will explore how literary texts sustain, challenge, or even ignore the reinvention of life and social relations typical of these times, and how politics, in turn, challenge literature.

Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?\n\nSociology is a huge field of study, and includes an enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

In this course, students will both practice and evaluate literary translation across four genres: poetry, fiction, drama, and literary non-fiction (essays, memoirs, autobiography, literary journalism, and so on).  We will explore various approaches to literary translation (including AI), critically assess multiple translations of the same work, and discuss essays and articles by translators past and present.  Students will translate one work in each of the four genres and submit a final translation with commentary in a genre of their choice for their final project. All translations to be done in English.  Prospective students must have advanced reading skills in a language other than English.  Instructor approval required.",

This course surveys the most powerful genres of Hollywood cinema's \"classical\" era, the period of studio production from the 1910s to about 1960. Focusing on the sound era this course introduces students to the study of Hollywood cinema as a mode of industrial cultural production at the dynamic intersection of art and mass culture. Our approach will be to study one film per week with an emphasis on formal analysis supplemented by readings from film theory and history. Films will likely include The Wizard of Oz (1939), Sullivan's Travels (1941), Now, Voyager (1942), Double Indemnity (1944), Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Singin' in the Rain (1952), among others. Readings may include writings by Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger, Altman, Cavell, L. Williams, and others. Assignments will include short papers, a video editing exercise (no expertise required), and a final project.",

Racial, gender, sexual, ethnic, cultural, economic, and political heterogeneity all require negotiation and sometimes lead to conflicts that play out in the streets and neighborhoods of major metropolises. Also, elite political and financial actors in cities have a heavy hand in shaping the direction of urban development and the allocation of resources. We will look at the role of both institutional actors and average city residents in affecting the following urban issues: housing and residential stratification by race and class, city financing and economic development, poverty, zoning, crime and policing, health and wellness, education, culture, and immigration.",

    "overview": "\"Stigmatized Sexualities\"\n\nFrom abstinence-only sex education programs to the public response to songs like WAP by Cardi B \u0026 Megan thee Stallion, we are bombarded with messaging that sexuality is stigmatized. But why is sexuality so taboo? How do social forces shape the way we view, experience, and regulate sexuality? Using a sociological lens, this course explores the intersection of sexuality and stigma. We will begin by exploring foundational theories of both stigma and sexuality in the social sciences. Armed with these frameworks, we will then engage with in-depth case studies of different stigmatized sexualities, including homosexuality \u0026 bisexuality, asexuality, HIV/AIDS, infidelity, sex work, kink, ethical non-monogamy, and disabled sexualities. The course will empower students to interrogate their own assumptions and to critically examine the forces that perpetuate sexual inequality in society. By the end of the course, students will have gained a deeper understanding of how stigma operates at both the individual and structural level. The final assignment requires students to write a proposal for a research project that would answer a sociological question of their choice about stigma and sexuality.\n\nTaught with GNDR_ST 331-0-20.",

    "overview": "In 1959, the island nation of Cuba shocked the world when a popular uprising overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista and established a socialist state lead by Fidel Castro. The Cuban Revolution was a divisive event; even as left-leaning political groups around the world heralded it as the dawn of a new world order, thousands of Cubans fled the island, many for the United States. In the more than six decades since 1959, the Revolution and its enigmatic leader(s) have been the subject of inspiration, imitation, and intense debate. And no one has been more involved in these \"Cuban Memory Wars,\" as historian Michael Bustamante has termed them, than Cubans themselves, both those on the island and those in the diaspora. In this course, we will look at how the Cuban Revolution has been portrayed and understood in Cuban literary and cultural production on both sides of the Florida Strait. In this journey, we will read a diverse array of texts produced in both Spanish and English - political speeches, films, short stories, scholarly essays, novels, memoirs and videos - in an attempt to understand how writers and artists in Cuba as well as Cubans and Cuban Americans in the U.S. have addressed questions of political engagement, national identity, the place of art in political revolution, and the challenges Cuba has faced in the post-Soviet era .",

How does the state govern disabled bodies, and to what degree does the state use disability as a form of political control? This course will first focus on theories of governmental control as they relate to people with disabilities and will then explore how disability is socially influenced, constructed, and implicated in power. In the second half of the course, we will focus on case studies from around the world. Together, we will examine the social and governmental mechanisms that regulate organ transplantation in Egypt, debilitation in Palestine, psychiatric disorders in Japan, and cochlear implantation in India. We will seek to understand the relationship between the state and people with disabilities, including how definitions of ‘normal' are imposed, perpetuated, and internalized at all levels of society, and how these definitions are contested by people with disabilities. Readings and materials will incorporate different mediums, including graphics and ethnographic film. Accessible readings from interdisciplinary scholars will address themes of artistic collaboration and community action in relation to race, gender, ability, and indigeneity. Along with participation, evaluation will be based on a site visit reflection, a class discussion facilitation, a short media analysis paper and presentation, and final paper or creative project.

    "overview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry—including description, rhetoric, story and song—and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

    "overview": "In her complementary, progressive set of essays, \"Poetry Is Not a Luxury\" and \"Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,\" Audre Lorde asserts that poetry - rather than being luxury or idle fantasy - is the \"disciplined attention to the true meaning of ‘it feels right to me'\" (37). Lorde defines poetry not as \"sterile word play\" but as \"a revelatory distillation of experience\" (37). Consequently, she situates the poetic in an inherent interrelation with the erotic, asserting that the erotic \"is not a question only of what we do; it is a question of how acutely and fully we can feel in the doing\" (54). Moving through a framework that insists on acutely and fully feeling what we do, as well as on doing and distilling what we feel in a manner that is revelatory, this course seeks to engage in Black feminist praxis - thinking alongside Lorde's conceptualizations of poetry and the erotic - to carefully examine myriad articulations of queer Black existence and embodied experience. \n\nThroughout the quarter, we will use these two essays from Sister Outsider as a springboard from which to explore the affective, intellectual, and creative significance of acute and full queer Black feelings and revelatory distillations of experience. These interventions are meant to highlight the ways that queer Black storytellers and tellers of queer Black stories - including poets, novelists, critical theorists, filmmakers, actors, painters, and performance artists - mobilize the poetic and erotic to access and articulate new modes of queer Black being, feeling, and doing.",

    "overview": "This course introduces students to the printmaking processes of relief and screen printing, encouraging them to conceptualize and create works of art as editions while also exploring the potential of prints as multiples in the context of installations. Contemporary artists increasingly employ printmaking in interdisciplinary ways, pushing the boundaries of scope and scale beyond the traditional confines of the measured print.\n\nStudents will examine the history of printmaking, with a focus on how contemporary artists reinterpret traditional techniques for innovative and unconventional expressions. The course covers the technical processes of screen printing and relief, integrating digital tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to develop digital matrices that can be altered or incorporated into analog printing workflows.\nThrough these methods, students will engage with conceptual frameworks to inspire and shape their projects. By the end of the course, they will have acquired the ability to produce images using a variety of printmaking techniques, with an emphasis on influencing and enriching their broader studio practice.\nThe course prioritizes hands-on practice, equipping students with the technical skills necessary to create diverse prints within the framework of installation-making. This practical work is complemented by critical analysis of course readings, creative workshops, in-class presentations, guest lectures, and targeted assignments. These elements will guide students in making thoughtful and informed explorations at the intersection of print media and contemporary installation practices.\nOpen to undergraduate students only.",

    "overview": "Course title: Tomb Robbers, Smugglers, and Millionaires: Looting and Trafficking of Antiquities in the Middle East\n\nOften referred to as the cradle of civilization, the Middle East is home to some of the world's earliest civilizations, whose physical remains provide invaluable insights into the development of human societies. However, this rich cultural heritage is constantly threatened by looting and illicit trafficking, especially during times of political and economic instability. Looting devastates cultural heritage, erasing invaluable historical records on humanity's shared history and depriving communities of their cultural identity.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the complex and multifaceted issue of looting and trafficking of antiquities in the Middle East. We will survey the rich archaeological heritage of the region and the historical significance of its antiquities as well as the history of looting and destruction of cultural material since antiquity. We will examine the historical, cultural, and economic factors that contribute to the illicit trade of cultural heritage, including poverty, conflict, and the demand for antiquities in the global market. We will consider the organized criminal networks involved in the trafficking of antiquities, from local looters to international dealers. We will investigate specific instances of looting and trafficking in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Egypt, and the efforts to recover stolen artifacts. Finally, we will discuss international laws, conventions, and ethical considerations related to the protection of cultural heritage. Through lectures, guest speakers, readings, and discussions, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in protecting cultural heritage in the Middle East. The course includes an optional field trip to the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures (ISAC) Museum at the University of Chicago to experience artifacts from the ancient Middle East firsthand.",

The course begins by interrogating the very notion of a canon. What is a canon for? How do they get formed? For what purpose and by whom? Are they still relevant? Can we form new canons? We then proceed to approach the \"canon\" through a series of modules, focusing on the work, legacies, and scholarly interlocutors of William James, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Mircea Eliade.",

    "overview": "Anthropology is often discussed as the study of human culture, where it originates, how it is transmitted, how it changes. But what is \"culture\"? Rather than a universal, one-size-fits-all answer, anthropologists today seek to understand how ideas and actions interact within specific social contexts. Through a focus on ethnography, a fundamental method of our field, students will learn how to conduct research into the processes that shape the social world, emphasizing human agency in relation to sociohistorical, economic, political, and environmental forces. Students will learn about the history of the field of anthropology and scholarly approaches across the discipline today. A key feature will be to denaturalize social assumptions, reinterpreting what we might know from our own contexts as a starting point to understand others. Students will design and carry out ethnographic research in which they write fieldnotes, conduct and transcribe interviews, and use other media to develop insights about their research topic.",

Within this period, we will consider a diverse range of media, including basketry, ceramics, textiles, jewelry, painting, sculpture, and performance, installation, video, film, photography and institutional critique to understand: \n\n- How engagements with settlers, scientists, and tourists placed aesthetic demands of \"tradition\" on Native art in the earliest moments westward expansion\n- How the political policy of assimilation worked in tandem with cultural appropriation in the early 20th century\n- How Native insistence on sovereignty and the Red Power Movement broke the established expectations settlers placed on Native artists\n- How Native artists have navigated the complexities of presenting their work within settler institutions\n- How Native art expresses Gerald Vizenor's idea of \"survivance,\" the \"renunciation of dominance, tragedy and victimry.\"  \n\nEach week, students will also be introduced to contemporary Native artists working over the past 20 years whose research-based practices shed new light on history.",

We will explore the complex networks, strategies, political dynamics, and institutional frameworks that shape the production, dissemination, and interpretation of African art today. By analyzing artworks from multiple perspectives, we will consider how the meaning and value of African art practices shift across local and global contexts. This course provides an in-depth understanding of the role of museum exhibitions, art biennials, publishing platforms, and transnational collaborations in shaping the field of contemporary African art. Through critical inquiry, we will explore how artists engage with geopolitical power structures and address issues related to gender, identity, and sexuality. Additionally, we will examine how contemporary practices respond to or draw inspiration from theories of environmental justice, diaspora, decolonization, feminism, modernism, globalization, and posthumanism. The course will cover a range of media, including film, installation, painting, photography, performance, sculpture, and sound.",

Meanwhile, numerous real-world applications can be treated as computational tasks on graphs. To facilitate these applications, a curial step is to learn good representations for graphs. More and more evidence has demonstrated that graph deep learning techniques especially graph neural networks (GNNs) have tremendously facilitated computational tasks on graphs. The revolutionary advances brought by GNNs have also immensely contributed to the depth and breadth of the adoption of graph representation learning in real-world applications.\n\nThis seminar course covers recent advances in the area of deep learning on graphs. More specifically, the following topics will be included: Network Embedding, Graph Neural Networks and Their Properties, Applications of GNNs, and others.",

    "overview": "This course invites students into an interdisciplinary, intersectional exploration of how Black sex and sexualities are imagined, governed, and experienced in the U.S. and beyond. Through an array of critical lenses, we will investigate the ways colonial, slavocratic, antiblack, capitalist, patriarchal, and heterosexist systems have shaped dominant discourses and practices surrounding Black sexuality. In undertaking this work, we will center Black voices, bodies, and desires, exploring how Black people have navigated, resisted, and redefined these constraints to articulate their own erotic lives.\n \nDrawing from a rich array of sources—including music, film, visual art, and performance art, as well as texts in Black feminist theory, queer of color critique, histories of sexualities, critical ethnography, and porn studies—students will engage with Black sexuality as a charged site where power, pleasure, vulnerability, and freedom intersect. By the end of the course, students will have developed tools to critically analyze representations of Black sexuality, while also considering the radical potential of Black eroticism as a space of self-expression, joy, and resistance.",

    "overview": "Earth System Modeling is an introduction to the art and science of reducing Earth's complex systems into simple numerical models. This course will survey core Earth system science topics, introduce numerical modeling concepts, and facilitate the construction of dynamical models in a hands-on computational laboratory environment. Core topics reviewed and modeled include Earth's energy balance, carbon cycle, and climate. The lecture portion of the course will highlight/review Earth science concepts, while the modeling component of the course will focus on the design, construction, and use of models to test hypotheses, and increase understanding of the forces and processes that shape the global environment. The modeling software to be used will be appropriate to undergraduates and beginning graduate students who do not have previous experience with solving differential equations or with computer programming, though students with these skill sets will appreciate the manifestation of numerical rules in the software package. Ultimately, this course is designed to empower students with introductory modeling skills that can be used to build a better understanding of how Earth's various components interact and evolve.",

    "overview": "This course will allow you to explore how fiction works. We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

    "overview": "This class explores the development of the concept of the so-called Homo Economicus in 19th-century literature, philosophy, law, and political economy. We will examine how ideas related to property, exchange, debt, and credit play a central role in the growing interconnection between emerging economic knowledge and literary representation, from Goethe and German Romanticism to the post-revolutionary literature of restoration and realism. Literature will be understood as a practice of extensive exchange. Following Adam Smith's influential work, The Wealth of Nations, the desire to accumulate wealth is crucial to the processes of subjectivization, positioning the modern bourgeois subject in a precarious situation at the intersection of industrialization, financialization, and colonial exploitation. Our readings will primarily focus on German literature, including works by Goethe, Novalis, Tieck, Stifter, Keller, and Freytag, alongside contemporary critical reflections from thinkers such as Marx, Proudhon, Sohn-Rethel, Marcuse, Schmitt, Heidegger, and Agamben.",

This course will focus in particular on the question of the identity of the Italian South, analysing some cases of orientalisation of it and comparing them with new forms of exaltation of its identity and specificity. Particular attention will be paid to the philosophical aspects that these reflections on art and literature imply, in order to answer some questions on the Italian case and the Mediterranean (but not only): does authenticity exist? Does it make sense to look for it? Is it true, as Franco Fortini argued while amending a dictum by Adorno in Minima moralia, that there is no true life except in the false?",

By investigating every aspect of a book of poetry in this way, you will be demonstrating what can be learned by attending not simply to the content of the poems, but also to the poetic and printed forms in which these poems originally circulated.  To do so is to engage in the interdisciplinary scholarly methods of what has come to be called Studies in the History of the Book, and by quarter's end, each member of the class will have pursued unique questions and reached unique conclusions about a single book that provides a window on the cultural work of poetry in the nineteenth-century United States.  You can read examples of what other students in past sections of this class have accomplished by checking out the website of their completed essays: https://sites.northwestern.edu/eng397/.\n\nAlongside this independent work, we will spend class meetings reading selectively from the vast archive of U.S. nineteenth-century poetry—an archive much more varied, in terms of both form and content, than the two poets who have most frequently come to represent it: Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.  In so doing, our classroom discussions will practice the same methodologies that each class member is undertaking with regard to a single book of poetry.",

Can one act feminist without reckoning with questions of race, capital, and the nation-state? Is the \"transnational civil society\" an agent for real liberation, or merely the latest iteration of the White Savior self-imagination? To answer these questions, this course will trace diverse voices for women's liberation across the globe, from the beginning of modernity through the contemporary age. From independence fighters in colonial India to the 2022 \"Woman Life Freedom\" protests in Iran, from 20th-century communist and anarchists revolutionaries to queer activists in China today, from past pan-Africanist visionaries to indigenous activists resisting ongoing expropriation, we will encounter women resisting simultaneously forces of local patriarchy and Western intervention. We will see how ideas of social justice, struggles for political autonomy, and women's liberation intertwine and travel across borders, and we will explore how transnational solidarities grow and engender new revolutionary aspirations.",

This class addresses these questions along with an analysis of the role of the law in producing multiracial people—and race, itself. Finally, we will examine what factors shape the identities of multiracial Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans. Drawing from demographics, popular culture, memoir, and academic studies, this class studies how multiracial people reflect the changing population in the US and reveal the social construction of race. Ultimately, we will be led to question our ideas about identity, race, and family while highlighting the expansive boundaries of \"Asian America\" and the people of Oceania.",

    "overview": "Whether it causes fear or fascination, blood holds a mysterious sway on the modern imagination. From those who faint at the sight of it, to those who love vampire movies and gory thrillers, to those who study and analyze it in labs, this strange substance serves as a constant source of conflict, anxiety, and ideology. Representations of blood in Christian art, literature, and theology have been just as fraught. Ancient and medieval Christians saw the substance as alternately miraculous and polluting, life-giving and death-bringing, a marker of difference and a symbol of unity. Blood had the capacity to reveal whether a person was sick or healthy, whether they were sexually active, what god they worshipped, and even whether they were guilty of murder. If it was shed on a battlefield it was considered valiant; if it was shed from the bodies of virgins or martyrs it was considered holy; if it was shed during childbirth or menstruation it was considered polluting; and if it was shed in pursuit of love it was considered romantic. The Christian language of blood and blood purity crept into developing ideas about race and sexuality, forging links between morality and embodiment that have in turn informed understandings of biology and human difference.\n\nIn this class, we will explore these complex and often contradictory representations of blood and bloodshed in Christian history. By approaching this topic from a range of sources and theoretical perspectives we will use blood as a starting point for exploring broader questions about gender, religion, race, culture, and individuality. Moreover, we will consider how historical assessments of blood value, purity, and pollution continue to shape constructions of identity today.",

Our geographic scope is global, given the worldwide reach of these technologies. We will examine how various regimes differ in their adoption and utilization of these technologies, how a variety of new actors arise on the political scene to challenge existing regimes, and how actors fail or succeed in their usage and incorporation of media/technologies. Among the key issues we will explore is the power to influence perception, the power to influence emotions, and the power to control narratives. We will see how thinkers and scholars understand these issues from a variety of perspectives, both old and new.",

    "overview": "This is an introductory course that covers the fundamentals of microeconomics. We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

This is mainly a workshop course on Catullus, with discussion focusing on questions to and from students enrolled in the class. Though translation will be a component in evaluation, it will be a relatively small criterion of success. The main topics of discussion will be how meaning and emphasis are communicated in the poetry of Catullus. Students will learn how to a) read the selected Latin texts with increasing accuracy and independence by strengthening vocabulary recall, syntactical knowledge, and reading comprehension strategies, b) place Catullus' poetry in its historical, literary, and cultural contexts with the help of commentaries, and c) evaluate different interpretations of the selected Latin poems and their composition. \n\nA grade of C- or better in this course satisfies the Weinberg language proficiency requirement.",

    "overview": "In this course, students will read selections of Ovid's Heroides. While Ovid is perhaps best known for his grand epic of forms changed into new bodies and his didactic poems on love, he is less known for his experiments in the epistolary genre, including a set of letters written from the perspective of mythological women abandoned by their heroic lovers. In these letters, the persona of the poet steps back and lets the familiar women of Greco-Roman mythology—Penelope, Dido, Medea, Ariadne, among others—\"write\" their own stories from their own perspectives. Each letter creates a distinct voice for its heroine, shaped by her relationship with the absent lover and the larger mythological context, offering a range of tones from rage to longing to defiance.\n\nStudents will analyze how Ovid, working at the intersection of epic, elegy, and epistolography, crafts these deeply emotional and personal narratives. How does he have each heroine think about her role in the lives of powerful men? How do they choose to handle their mistreatment? How do the letters challenge or reinforce the ideal of the Roman matrona, and what does this reveal about Roman cultural expectations in light of Augustus' contemporary moral legislation? Should these letters be read as proto-feminist texts giving women a chance to speak back to both their oppressors and a literary tradition that has often marginalized them? By engaging with the Heroides, students will explore how Ovid's innovative use of genre and voice invites reflection on broader themes of gender, power, and cultural identity in the ancient world.",

    "overview": "Aesthetics of El Barrio: Representations and Resistances\n\nIn Latin America, el barrio is both a marginalized urban space inhabited by working-class communities and a site of collective identity and cultural expression, reflecting the region's social, economic, and political realities. This course explores the diverse aesthetics of el barrio, examining it as both an urban space and a defining experience within the region's cultural imaginaries. Through contemporary cultural productions—including literary texts, films, and songs—as well as case studies of grassroots initiatives and recent protest movements, students will analyze how issues of race, class, gender, and migration shape the representation and lived experiences of these spaces. The course also provides tools to critically examine the role of barrios and their communities as sites of both social stigmatization and cultural resistance. Covering works and examples from countries such as Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina, alongside Latinx barrios in U.S. cities like New York and Chicago, students will develop interdisciplinary approaches to understanding how these spaces and communities are portrayed and politicized in cultural texts and media.

    "overview": "What does it mean to \"write home\" - write of home, write to home - when you can no longer return to that home, whether by force, choice, or circumstance? How do poems reach across oceans and continents, in and out of exile? How does one find or make a poetic \"home\" within a diaspora (a word that refers to the movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland)? How do poetic depictions of home carry within them the enormous histories, memories, and experiences of a distant or absent homeland? Together we will explore these questions as we read a wide range of poems about the experiences of being in exile, in diaspora, and at home. At the same time, we will read about and discuss the political and philosophical stakes of being a diasporic subject in our current moment, as the consequences of climate change, war, and political repression have created a global refugee crisis of previously unimaginable scale. Concurrently, we will also seek to answer questions about poetry itself: how do poems written in diaspora imagine - or reimagine - home? Are there unique ways in which diasporic poetry makes meaning? What can diasporic poetry teach us about reading and writing poetry in general? We will be reading works about exile, home, and homeland by poets from a variety of diasporic traditions around the world, as well as critical texts in diaspora studies and de- and post-colonial theory. Throughout, you'll also be honing your skills as a writer, learning to pose questions, fashion arguments, and develop your own authorial voice.",

We will also read longer passages of unaltered Greek, including passages from the New Testament and a song of Sappho. Thereafter students will be able to progress to a wide range of genres from the classical and post-classical periods, including ancient Greek history, poetry, philosophy, drama, and more.",

In this course, we will discuss both the biological myth and social reality of race.   Specifically, this course provides an overview of the prominent theories/theorists of race and  ethnicity, and is concerned with: 1) Understanding the early science of race used to justify racial classification and thinking, 2) reviewing the theories regarding the nature and persistence of  race and ethnicity as meaningful social groupings in society, and 3) explaining the social  significance of these group identities (e.g., how they are related to social stratification,  social-cultural relations, and the political and economic dynamics in society).\n\nWe will begin our review with the origins of the concept race, then move from early perspectives to the present in an aim to understand the influential theories and theorists.  As we proceed in our investigation we will continuously ask: 1) What are the key assumptions, propositions and concepts  of each theory?, 2) How is the theory located within the larger theoretical tradition? 3) Does this theory agree or disagree with other views in the field? 4) What is the level of empirical support  for the theory? 5) To what extent does the theory help to explain contemporary patterns of race and ethnicity across time and space in the United States? and 6) How might one undermine systems of racial inequality if the respective theory is holds?\"",

Adopting a transdisciplinary approach, the main objective is to explore the consequences of language contact and plurilingualism in individual speakers and societies, particularly in the context of Spanish in the US. Students will delve into topics such as the linguistic practices of Spanish-speaking communities in the US, with specific attention to those in Chicago and Evanston, language ideology, language maintenance through education and policy, or bilingual acquisition and language processing, among others.",

    "overview": "This intensive writing workshop is designed for and limited to third-year PhD students in the Department of Art History who are writing the dissertation prospectus. The dual purpose of this seminar is to present students with a clear understanding of what constitutes a successful dissertation prospectus for their field of study and to provide them with ample time, space, resources, and feedback (in consultation with their advisor) to produce a workable prospectus draft by the end of the quarter. We will address the different functions that a prospectus serves, namely as a guide to help structure the research and writing phases of the dissertation; we will learn from advanced graduate students and faculty how to think about the prospectus as the foundation for later fellowship and grant applications, studying examples of successful prospectuses and subsequent applications; and we will explore resources designed to help students develop a structured but adaptable writing practice. In addition to workshopping their own proposals, students will learn the art of peer review in providing critiques of fellow students' work in progress.",

But there are reasons—from science and from philosophy—for doubting whether we really are free (and therefore whether we really are responsible). In this course, we will examine several different ways of thinking about freedom and responsibility and consider whether they are compatible with scientific ways of thinking about the world. Along the way, we will also look at how freedom and responsibility are connected to other issues, such as responsibility in the legal system, addiction, mitigated responsibility, and the meaning of what it is to be a person.",

We'll explore how language is a social practice that is situated in history, and how language can reflect, reinforce, create, and contest societal power structures. Students will participate in hands-on quantitative research in sociolinguistic variation to examine directly how the social and linguistic are intertwined.",

    "overview": "How do healthcare systems and approaches to wellness differ across cultural and linguistic contexts? This course is designed especially for students planning a career in the health professions, global health, and/or public health.\" In this course, students will gain knowledge of the different models of healthcare systems in Francophone countries as well as familiarity with some specific terminologies and grammatical structures employed in the field. Using communicative and task-based approaches, students will discuss current issues, examine and reflect on ethical beliefs and values, through topics such as healthcare access, terminal illness, the use of technology etc.\n\nClass discussions and activities as well as written assignments will be based on videos, readings and press articles, related to the medical field. Students will research topics and share their findings through oral presentations. They will also explore their personal area of interest in the field.\n\nNote: For students in Global Health Studies, this course is approved as a non-GHS elective.\n\nStudents' testimonies:\n\"This course teaches so much not just about the technical aspects of health and healthcare, but also provides a well-rounded approach to the French language and the cultures of Francophone countries. Taking this course allowed me to expand my vocabulary, practice my reading and oral comprehension skills, and perfect my presentation techniques through exploring my own topics of interest. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in healthcare or even just French language and culture!\"\n\"I really appreciated taking a French class such as this one. For the most part, I've never really encountered coursework in French that integrates my passions in my both major and my intended career path. This course allowed for that intersection, and not only taught me more about the various domains and approaches in medicine, but also emphasized the perspectives of the people involved, which I believe is very important to understand working in a field that is very reliant on human services.\"",

He was dark-skinned, pierced and tattooed, and he had led the Maya people of Chetumal to war for two decades. But he was also in his own way white, a fellow Spaniard called Gonzalo Guerrero, and his three children, born of marriage with a Maya woman, might be seen as the first Mexicans. The history of Mexico, understood as the country and people that grew from those first contacts, began with that Spaniard in 1511 when his caravel foundered on Scorpion Reef over sixty miles north of the Yucatán peninsula.

It was Friedrich Nietzsche's famous characterization of German 19th century culture as a crass \"fetish-being,\" which introduced the notion of the fetish into the vocabulary of cultural analysis. Since its origin in the ethnographic writings of the enlightenment in the 17th and 18th century, and therefore deeply rooted in the European colonial exploitation of Africa, the fetish appears in many different incarnations in such heterogeneous discourses as theology, Marxism, sociology, psychoanalysis, the clinical psychiatry of sexual deviance, modernist aesthetics, popular culture, and anthropology. This class will give a historical survey of these transformations by focusing on crucial representations of fetishism in literature, philosophy, and film exploring the nexus of colonialism, political economy, and sexual deviancy.",

From Vichy France in the West to the occupied Soviet territories in the East, the persecution, expropriation, and murder of millions necessitated the participation of countless civilians and state officials. With a special focus on Eastern Europe, where the greatest number of Jews lived and nearly all of the murdered died, we will explore questions of local complicity, the motives of perpetrators and of those who sought to impede them, and the responses of the continent's Jews and other victims to the onslaught. The course will conclude with postwar efforts to punish the Holocaust's perpetrators, to commemorate its victims, and to deny that genocide was even committed.",

    "overview": "The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, promised equal protection and due process for all, and it declared that all persons born in the United States were citizens of the United States. The amendment's consequences for American federalism were vast. But the change was even greater than that, for Americans began to understand rights differently.  Much of today's rights-based culture—including ideas about the right to marry, the right to privacy, and the right to be free of discrimination—is founded in the Fourteenth Amendment and its legal and cultural legacies.",

    "overview": "The early twentieth century in Ukraine, the Russian Empire, and the Soviet Union experienced an explosion of activity in the arts. In theatre, the director emerged from an increased interest in artistically unified theatrical works; avant-garde easel painters began designing for the stage; a vibrant underground cabaret culture flourished; and the first political theatres were forged. This course examines how a rapidly growing pluralism of artistic perspectives and a series of wars, most notably the 1917 October Revolution, inspired one of the most prolific theatrical periods in history in the years before Stalinist totalitarianism crushed its innovations.",

    "overview": "This course is a critical look at immigration in the United States. Despite popular imagery that casts the United States as a ‘nation of immigrants', immigration has long been a contested arena of public debate, characterized by cycles of openness and xenophobia. Debates over who is worthy of being considered for inclusion in the U.S. as workers, as rights-bearing members of our communities, and potentially, as citizens, are fueled by racialized and politicized ideas of who is deserving or capable of being considered American. \n\nWith a focus on post-1965 immigration trends, policies, and issues in the U.S., this course will cover how sociologists have analyzed, understood, and critiqued various immigration issues, including questions of integration, race, and belonging; national identity, assimilation, and transnationalism; lawful and unlawful entry; deportation; legalization, amnesty, asylum, and deferred action; and citizenship. \n\nGiven the current political moment, we will also work together to make sense of contemporary political debates, and policies, and how they link to, or diverge from, historical patterns. Throughout, we will also consider how immigration links to key areas of power, difference, and inequality.\n\nWhile this class will center on sociological perspectives, we will also draw from legal studies, political science, history, and other fields throughout the course. As such, interdisciplinary perspectives are also welcome in this course.",

Does a country's colonial experience shape its future political and economic possibilities? These questions, and many more, have been addressed by statistical research in political science. This course explores quantitative/statistical research methods in the social sciences, with the goal of helping students learn how to carry out statistical social science research of their own. To that end, we will review the basics of statistical theory and quantitative research design. We will also examine applications of these methods to various topics in political science. Throughout, the emphasis will be on practical, applied advice for constructing and successfully completing quantitative research in political science and related fields.",

This course will introduces you to a wide-range of processes and problems of mediated political communication, from elections, political advertising, and political news to political entertainment, humor, and social media, etc. primarily within a democratic context, specifically the United States. Furthermore, political communication is fabric that holds a participatory democracy together - and thus our examination of political communication is intrinsically tied to understanding the health of American democracy and how political communication contributes to it for better or worse. Lastly, whilst while many of the processes and patterns of political communication we discuss in this class are generalizable to the United States, they should not be taken to represent the global norm as unfortunately democracy, especially American-style democracy, is the exception not the rule across the globe.",

    "overview": "What is ‘normal?' How do societal definitions of normal impact the experiences of people with disabilities? How does the state govern disabled bodies, and to what degree does the state use disability as a form of political control? This course will first focus on theories of governmental control as they relate to people with disabilities and will then explore how disability is socially influenced, constructed, and implicated in power. In the second half of the course, we will focus on case studies from around the world. Together, we will examine the social and governmental mechanisms that regulate organ transplantation in Egypt, debilitation in Palestine, psychiatric disorders in Japan, and cochlear implantation in India. We will seek to understand the relationship between the state and people with disabilities, including how definitions of ‘normal' are imposed, perpetuated, and internalized at all levels of society, and how these definitions are contested by people with disabilities. Readings and materials will incorporate different mediums, including graphics and ethnographic film. Accessible readings from interdisciplinary scholars will address themes of artistic collaboration and community action in relation to race, gender, ability, and indigeneity. Along with participation, evaluation will be based on a site visit reflection, a class discussion facilitation, a short media analysis paper and presentation, and final paper or creative project. In addition, there will be two movie screenings scheduled during the quarter.",

In this course, we will think about the ways that heterosexuality has been socially constructed since its invention, drawing on a range of literary texts, films, and objects from popular culture across the last century. We will address questions like: how does the construction of heterosexuality interact with the oppression of women? How does the definition of heterosexuality depend on queer others? How does the history of heterosexuality relate to the history of whiteness and racism? After reflecting on the history of heterosexuality, students will be asked at the course's conclusion to present and analyze an artifact of heterosexuality from their own experience.",

At the beginning of the three-quarter sequence, students are not expected to be able to speak, understand, read, or write any Hindi-Urdu. In the first quarter (Hindi-Urdu 111-1) the students are introduced to the Hindi (Devanagari) script and to aspects of Hindi-Urdu grammar. By the end of this quarter the students will be able to talk about their family, their routines, their likes and dislikes, and also describe actions in progress. In the second quarter (Hindi-Urdu 111-2), students continue to learn new grammatical constructions, and by the end of the quarter they are able to talk about events in the past and the future. In the third quarter (Hindi-Urdu 111-3), students learn to express possibilities, wants, abilities and capabilities. They also learn finer aspects of grammar. By the end of this quarter students achieve intermediate-low language skills in Hindi-Urdu.",

Using Turkey as the class's main case study but also discussing intersections between popular music and nationalism from Mexico and the United States to Greece, Brazil, and beyond, we will also explore issues like globalization, cultural flows, gender, queerness, and social movements related to music. The class will follow the major turning points of Turkey's history (the westernization movements of the late Ottoman Empire, the establishment of the Turkish Republic, military coups and other crises, social and everyday transformations) through its important musicians, genres, and scenes. While studying specific musical trends (like rock 'n' roll, for example) and their social/historical underpinnings, the class will provide students with broader methodologies and theories for using popular culture and music in the study of history.",

    "overview": "This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to major issues in the history of the Middle East and North Africa since the nineteenth century, and also an introduction to Middle East studies as a field of study. That is, we will seek to understand how the modern Middle East was \"made,\" as well as how something called \"the Middle East\" emerged as a geopolitical entity and a conceptual category. Among the topics explored are the history of the idea of the \"Middle East\" and the multiple meanings of \"modernity\" in that context; the complex relations between the Middle East and the West; the historical formation of Middle East nation-states, polities, ideologies, identities, and economies; and the dynamic struggles unfolding in the region since the 2011 Arab uprisings. The course will consider the making of these structures, events, and relationships from a range of perspectives, including imaginative ones. Course material will encompass literary, cinematic, historical, and social science materials, as well as both primary documents and secondary scholarly sources.",

This course explores \"play\" as a form of engagement with the world and our own self that is grounded in both perception and imagination. We will focus on the ways audiovisual technologies (from film and photography to videogames) shape our sense of play and, with it, our consciousness and sense of social being at crucial moments in history.\n\nWe start by attending to a brief history of the \"play drive,\" from German Romanticism to psychoanalysis and postcolonial theory. We then focus on Italian cinema as a case study and reassess its contribution by foregrounding play as the expression of both historical trauma and historical hope. Finally, we turn to one of the most widespread forms of contemporary play, video games, and investigates their relation to globalization and warfare.",

    "overview": "Predictive algorithms and big data are increasingly being used by firms and policymakers to guide high-stakes decisions, with a range of ethical, social, and policy implications. This course covers theoretical frameworks for thinking through those implications. The course is split into four parts, which model these issues at different scales. The first part of the course starts with the individual decision maker. We cover foundational theories regarding what information is and how it is used in decision problems. The second part of the course considers acquisition of information by a decision-maker and consequences for learning. The third part of the course considers the interaction between an agent and an algorithm. We cover topics regarding strategic data disclosure and manipulation. The final part of the course considers broader social implications of algorithm design, with an emphasis on recent topics regarding fairness in algorithm decision-making. The objective of the course is not to provide any \"answers\" regarding the questions raised, but rather to equip students with tools and frameworks that they can use to develop their own analyses of emerging social issues related to big data and algorithms.",

At the end of the full 102 sequence (102-1,2,3), students are expected to create with the language when talking and writing about familiar topics, to understand the main ideas and some supporting details from a variety of texts (newspaper articles, short stories, etc.), to describe and narrate, with some consistency, in all major time frames while organizing their discourse into paragraphs. Students will significantly increase their knowledge of Italy's history and culture and they will be guided to become independent learners. After the completion of the entire sequence of Italian 102, students will be eligible to study in Italy and will be ready to embark on the minor or major in Italian. The second-year Italian course sequence fulfills the two-year WCAS language requirement. The classroom is very lively, with lots of conversation, partnering, and small group exercises.",

We consider archeological evidence to explore the earliest uses and meanings of the plant in antiquity and how it spread from Central Asia to the rest of the planet. We also examine various types of historical works to comprehend what roles cannabis played in the rise of maritime empires and the formation of a global capitalist world. Then, we revisit some of the urban and rural cultures in various parts of the world that modernized the plant's uses and meanings in the 20th century. We also study scientific, legal, and pop-culture materials to elucidate what was at stake in the most heated controversies and campaigns against and in favor of the plant. We conclude analyzing the most recent debates and policies on decriminalization and\nlegalization in North and South America in a comparative perspective, and their socio-economic, political, and environmental implications. We address these topics reading history, anthropology, sociology, political science, and journalism; and watching and analyzing critically songs, advertisement, literature, feature films, and documentary movies.",

    "overview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\nThe instructor of \"Lessons in Non-Profit Management\" is: Katie Hytros\n\nThis course is jointly sponsored by Business Institutions and a student organization called campusCatalyst.  The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

Throughout the course, we will read texts from both central, canonical writers and more marginal, contemporary ones. Additionally, we will examine aspects of gender, sexuality, and ethnicity in Hebrew literature. Ultimately, this course will allow students to discover the beauty and richness of modern Hebrew literature. The literary works will be accompanied by films, academic articles, and theoretical texts. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel, or Judaism is required! All the Hebrew texts will be read in translation.",

In this course, students will continue developing the four skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and learn various aspects of Japanese culture and society through readings, videos, written assignments, and in-class activities.\nThe emphasis will be on developing the skills necessary to describe not only their own experiences and daily lives, but also their community, general trend, and what is happening in society, while increasing vocabulary and sentence structures that they can use more precisely. Students will also practice summarizing a story that they heard, read, or watched. Careful and thorough review and preparation for each class session are expected. With consistent oral and written feedback from the instructor, students will enhance their language and cultural awareness, leading to increased understanding, appreciation, and utilization of the target language, to become autonomous learners.",

It introduces students to key theories and questions that define political psychology as a discipline, exploring how people form and change political attitudes, the extent to which they are open to evidence that challenges their views, and whether their voting decisions are based on policy alignment or shaped by identity, stereotypes, and prejudice. We will also examine what drives individuals to engage in collective action, why some disengage from politics, and how emotions, social identity, personality traits, and cognitive styles influence political judgment. By engaging with these and related questions, this course—and political psychology as a discipline—empirically evaluates the nature and quality of democratic citizenship, assessing whether citizens and leaders are capable of sound political judgment and whether they hold, and are willing to uphold, democratic values.",

Understanding vegetative and reproductive structures of plants, and use of this knowledge to identify plants with taxonomic keys will be emphasized. Ecological interactions, adaptations, and related conservation issues will also be discussed. The lecture portion of the course will take place at Evanston campus on Mondays. We will meet on Wednesdays for the field experience outdoors at the Chicago Botanic Garden or at nearby natural areas, though the first field classes of the quarter will be held at Northwestern.",

These are all conditions that can be analyzed within the advent and context of late global capitalism which is also often referred to as neoliberalism, or post-Fordism. The first part of this course will analyze the impetus and structural characteristics of neoliberalism or late global capitalism to better understand how it has been manifested in many of the crises already mentioned. In this section, we will scrutinize the function and logics of capitalism to identify how and why the shift from a Fordist to a Post-Fordist political economy transpired. Special attention will be paid to how capitalism interacts with and is informed by racial, colonial, and gender logics to exacerbate the vulnerability of Black, Indigenous, Brown, and other racialized groups to exploitation, removal, and premature death. We will also focus on how the situations that racialized groups in the global north face are relationally tied to the precarity that racialized populations in the global south endure. The second section of the seminar will scrutinize the ideological and psychosocial components of neoliberalism. It will focus on how neoliberalism is a corresponding ethic or mode of governance intended to atomize a polity, emphasize individualism, and thus disrupt nodes of solidarity and mutual aid. In this sense, neoliberalism influences how concepts such as liberation, freedom, or justice are theorized, imagined, taught, and organized around. This section of the seminar also foregrounds the university as an integral location for the study of neoliberalism. It focuses on how insurgent critiques of power once associated with the Third World Left of the Cold War era have been de-emphasized in favor of a growing emphasis on therapeutic adjustment, bourgeoise performances of excellence, recognition, safe space, and care.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs. This course is the third in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants.",

The class begins with an overview of the framework and methods of Reception Studies, and a short account of some technical tools and terminology necessary to appropriately examine the audiovisual aspects of film. Equipped with these analytical instruments, we will discuss selected ancient narratives, both mythological and historical, and then interrogate the mechanisms through which those stories have been adapted to the technological apparatuses, sociocultural expectations, and economic dynamics constitutive of the practice of modern filmmaking. Through an eclectic selection of film adaptations from different periods and parts of the world, we will interrogate the ways world cinema negotiates between the \"old\" and the \"new,\" both by deploying visual and narrative techniques to depict ancient motifs, and by using those tales to convey modern historical preoccupations, political ideals, and cultural expectations.",

    "overview": "The third quarter of second-year Latin combines literary analysis with mastery of grammar and syntax at the intermediate level. This is mainly a workshop course on Catullus, with discussion focusing on questions to and from students enrolled in the class. Though translation will be a component in evaluation, it will be a relatively small criterion of success. The main topics of discussion will be how meaning and emphasis are communicated in the poetry of Catullus. Students will learn how to a) read the selected Latin texts with increasing accuracy and independence by strengthening vocabulary recall, syntactical knowledge, and reading comprehension strategies, b) place Catullus' poetry in its historical, literary, and cultural contexts with the help of commentaries, and c) evaluate different interpretations of the selected Latin poems and their composition. \n\nA grade of C- or better in this course satisfies the Weinberg language proficiency requirement.",

    "overview": "There is no understating the significance of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in Western Culture. The Bible is a text that has been repeatedly turned to for spiritual guidance, for explanations of mankind\\'s origins and as the basis of both classical art and contemporary cinema. English idiom is peppered with phrases that originate in the Hebrew Bible and many a modern political clash can be understood as a conflict over the Bible\\'s messages and their implications. This course introduces students to the Hebrew Bible by reading sections of most of the Bible\\'s books. But reading is itself a complicated enterprise. The Bible has been put to many different uses; even within the world of academic scholarship, the Bible is sometimes a source of history, sometimes a religious manual, sometimes a primitive legal code and sometimes a work of classical literature.\n\nThis course will introduce students to the various challenges that present themselves within the study of the Hebrew Bible and the varied approaches scholars take when reading the Hebrew Bible. This course is a critical introduction to the Hebrew Bible.",

You may have seen them in pornography, but have you ever wanted to study and talk about sex, and specifically, how to have a satisfying sex life? Many people look to pornography not just for entertainment, but also for education about what satisfying sexual encounters look like. Unfortunately, much of what people learn from pornography doesn't lead them to healthy and satisfying sexual encounters and relationships. This lecture class isn't actually about pornography. It goes beyond many presumptions about sex and pleasure depicted in pornography, the media, and popular culture, in order to equip students with information that can lead to more satisfying and healthy sexual experiences across their lifespan, regardless of how they identify, or who or what they like. The course also familiarizes students with a wide spectrum of human identities, practices, and attitudes towards sex and sexuality. The course includes lectures from guest speakers with particular expertise or experience in topics covered. Possible topics covered include: physiological and biological sex; gender; sexual orientation; homophobia and heterosexism; navigating sexual risks in a sex-positive way; sexual health disparities; sexual desire, arousal, and response; solitary sex \u0026 sex with others; sex toys; unconventional sexual practices; intimacy and effective communication; sexuality \u0026 aging; sexuality, disability \u0026 intimacy; sexual problems and solutions; sexual harassment and violence; selling sex; and hallmarks of great relationships; race, gender \u0026 sexuality, and yes, dotted through the quarter are some references to pornography.",

It is often highly concentrated, generating concerns about competition, and a big emitter of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, generating concerns about the environment. As a consequence, the energy sector is subject to substantial economic and environmental regulation. We will use economic theory and empirical evidence to analyze the real-world operation of electricity, oil, and natural gas markets. These tools will allow us to critically understand how these markets are regulated. We will examine policies in a range of current topics. For example: Why has the performance of electricity markets been debated? Who pays the bill of carbon regulation? What are the pros and cons of renewable energy policies? What are the prospects for energy efficiency improvements? The course will draw upon material taught in Economics 310-1, 310-2, and 281, with the tools from Econ 310-1 and 281 being absolutely essential.",

This class has two goals—first, providing an overview of literature written by Asian Americans in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries and placing these texts in conversation with key concepts from Asian American culture and history. Second, interrogating the constructed, pan-ethnic nature of Asian American identity, a category that came into use only in the 1960s as a coalitional entity defined by shared histories of labor, discrimination, and national and cultural unbelonging.",

The subject will be approached by discussing the question of the political agency of subaltern individuals. The peasant uprisings for land in Southern Italy between the first and second half of the 20th century will be studied and will be related to the reading of these struggles by the left-wing parties of the time (the Italian Communist Party and Socialist Party). During the course, the theoretical assumptions of these political events will be discussed, analysing among other things the role of folklore, the question of political subjectivity, and the use of analogy in the study of the relationship between Western revolutions and those on the European and African shores of the Mediterranean.",

    "overview": "This course takes stock of Black politics in the U.S. in the decades since the Civil Rights Movement. We will explore Blacks' ongoing and still fitful quest for racial equality and democratic responsiveness. Our review will pay close attention to the internal dynamics of Black politics. As we chart Blacks' political gains and setbacks, we will focus on class, gender, and other cleavages in the population to see how different groups have fared. We also will examine Blacks' fraught relations with whites, their engagement with mainstream political institutions, and their efforts to secure their rights and advance their interests from within and outside these institutions at the national and local level. The course materials cover a mix of topics that have occupied students of race and American politics since the Civil Rights Movement. These include: ongoing intergroup conflict and prejudice; segregation; social provision and criminal justice policies; systemic anti-Black racism in law enforcement; racial dynamics in voting and access to the ballot; partisan politics; and Blacks' electoral fortunes, including the election of the country's first Black president and the ensuing political developments. The overarching goal of the course is to shed light on the state of American democracy by studying the contemporary political experiences of Blacks.",

We will read a variety of authors from the late 20th and early 21st centuries whose work aims to reimagine the role of character, moral psychology, and human flourishing within ethical life. We will study writings from philosophers such as Bernard Williams, Martha Nussbaum, John McDowell, and Iris Murdoch, investigating their critiques of utilitarian and deontological theories and their attempts to develop alternative frameworks for thinking about morality. Through these readings, we will explore the ways in which this recent tradition can offer us new insights into the nature and complexity of ethical life.",

The approach to the course will be primarily linguistic; we will investigate various aspects of language as used by members of various sexual identies, focusing on the language of and about gay men and lesbians. Among the topics to be covered will be \"reclaimed epithets\" (e.g. \"dyke\" and \"queer\"), gender vs. sexuality vs. sex, coming-out stories as gay genre, the sexual lexicon, cross-cultural sexual diversity, and the general role of language in creating, reifying, and reproducing sexual categories, identities, and intimacy.",

    "overview": "Chemistry 350-1,2,3 is a full-year, 3-quarter laboratory course intended to be taken by all students in the junior year of the chemistry major program. As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence. As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors. \n\nThe full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of: \n\nInstrumental analysis; \nSynthesis of inorganic compounds; \nSynthesis of organic compounds; \nSpectroscopy. \n\nThe course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. \n\nCHEMISTRY 350-3: The 3rd course in this sequence covers the very important topic of spectroscopy from a physical chemistry point of view. It deals with the use of various spectroscopic techniques (FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, uv/visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) for structure determination of gas and liquid phase molecules and for kinetics measurements. In addition, you will be asked to design and carry out a 4-week research project at the end of the quarter based on some aspect of course material in the entire Chem 350-1,2,3 sequence.",

Sociologists, historians, and literary critics have long tried to understand why narratives of crime hold such allure for the multitudes of people who consume them in the form of books, weekly podcasts, Netflix specials, videoessays, feature-length films, as well as contemporary art exhibits. However, if fictional stories of crime fascinate, narratives that purport to tell a true story fascinate even more so. The course will explore the history of True Crime as a genre in Latin America through the analysis of a diverse group of cultural artifacts and literary works from two countries: Brazil and Argentina. In the class we will discuss materials ranging from novels (Piglia, Lins, Almada) and films (Aïnouz, Piñeyro) to photographs, podcasts, sensationalistic tabloid articles, and even digitized archival criminal case files. At the center of our discussions will be the question: What truth do these narratives of crime hold and for whom?\n\nThe class will be taught in English and the course materials will be available both in English translation as well as in the original Spanish and Portuguese.",

    "overview": "People use language to convey information. What makes a language suitable for this purpose, and how does it work? This question is at the center of the study of linguistic meaning. In this course, we will consider questions like these: How do the meanings of words like \"everyone\", \"a\", \"hit\", and \"saw\", give rise to the similarities and differences between \"Everyone saw a hit,\" \"Everyone hit a saw,\" \"A saw hit everyone\", etc.? Can we always tell for sure what a given sentence means, and does it mean the same on all occasions? Does meaning come from sentences or from a speaker's use of sentences? What are the different types of meaning (e.g., linguistic, contextual, social)? What's the place of meaning in an overall theory of language? We will explore a variety of approaches to these questions and discuss their theoretical assumptions, methodological tools, and empirical strengths and weaknesses. LING 270 satisfies the WCAS Area II (Formal Studies) Distribution Requirement and the Empirical and Deductive Reasoning Foundational Discipline (FD-EDR) Requirement.",

    "overview": "Wynter's Fanon: Race, Gender, Coloniality\n\nA revolutionary, thinker, psychiatrist, and physician, Frantz Fanon (1925-1961) produced a diverse and groundbreaking work from Martinique to Algeria that has shapedgenerations of activists and scholars. As wide-reaching as his works were, there have been many different Fanons that have been engaged over the years. A novelist, dancer, and scholar, Sylvia Wynter (1928-present) has written extensively from Jamaica to the U.S. on the Caribbean, colonialism, and what it means to be human, similarly shaping generations of activists and scholars.\n \nThis graduate seminar will examine major writings of Frantz Fanon in relation to the writings by Sylvia Wynter, to focus on Wynter's Fanon. Touching on colonialism, anti-Blackness, the racialized gender system, the Caribbean, and multiple revolutions and paradigm shifts, Wynter infused Fanon's writings with new depth and problems. The course encourages seminar participants to think critically with and about Fanon's and Wynter's work, to incorporate both into their research and explore the renewed significance of Fanon's work today.\n \nTo enroll in the course, please email an inquiry to the instructor with: *brief* description of 1) your research interests, 2) previous course work (if any) on race, gender, and colonialism, and 3) how this course will help you on your research.",

    "overview": "We will spend the term delving deeply into the meaning and significance of a play often said to be at the heart of Shakespeare's canon and of modern Western culture more generally.  Devoting a full course to one play will allow us to read this enduringly important, exceptionally enigmatic tragedy intensively, scene by scene, sometimes line by line.  At the same time, it will allow us to see the many and sometimes conflicting Hamlets that have existed since about 1600, when it was first written and performed.  We will read the three early (and different) printed versions of the play from Shakespeare's time.  We will also encounter the play through the lenses and tools of several modern critical approaches that have sought to address the mystery of the play and its central character: psychoanalytic Hamlet, post-structuralist Hamlet, Marxist Hamlet, new historicist Hamlet, feminist and queer Hamlets, Hamlet and race, alongside the critical perspectives of some film versions and Tom Stoppard's ingenious revision.  \"To be or not to be,\" as we will see, is not the only question.",

In this course, you will learn to use two major computational tools for exploring the microbiome and its interactions with the human body. After a brief introduction to sample processing for DNA sequencing, we will use QIIME2 to describe microbiome composition and HUMANn4 to describe microbiome functional potential. Foundational microbiome research focused mainly on the gut will be discussed throughout the course, and the final product of the course will be a meta-analysis of publicly available microbiome data.",

As a category of cultural, social, and political analysis, \"Black Portraiture\" encompasses a range of creative forms, from collage and comics to film, painting, photography, and sculpture. In this seminar, we will explore recurring approaches to producing and theorizing the likeness of Black subjects since the advent of the twentieth century. We will critically question the utility and limitations of portraiture, asking what desires it fulfills and whose interests it serves. Through a range of case studies, we will interrogate the role of art criticism and the art market in shaping the value, reception, and institutionalization of Black Portraiture. Students will probe notions of \"visibility\" and \"representation,\" carefully considering the increasingly blurred boundaries between empowerment and exploitation. Additionally, we will engage with debates surrounding the influence of social media, meme culture, and artificial intelligence on evolving definitions of portraiture. Students will ultimately gain a deeper understanding of portraiture's cultural and political stakes and its ability to both shape and reflect racialized systems of power.",

    "overview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

Marie-Antoinette's lavish gowns and towering wigs, the empire-waist dresses of Regency England, and richly printed calico muslins, among other objects, will be understood through the histories of race, colonialism, science, and industry. Who made these garments? What materials did they use and where were these materials from? How was fashion deployed as a tool to perform power, gender, race, and national identity? What is the relationship between fashion and art? Throughout this course, we will also engage with contemporary art and popular culture with the goal of understanding the historical legacy and fetishization of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century period dress.",

    "overview": "Across all industries, employers consistently rank written and oral communication in the top five skills that a new employee needs. However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

    "overview": "This course offers undergraduates an introduction to studying the phenomena of religion in relationship to dynamics of media, society, and culture. The course content highlights a variety of themes, issues, figures, and narratives, while examining diverse religious practices, productions, communities, representations and identities. In this course, we dive into one of today's most exciting and rapidly growing areas of scholarship - the intriguing intersections and complex entanglements of religion and media in popular culture. Drawing from a diverse array of interdisciplinary sources, we will explore what media studies and communication theories have to offer the study of religion, and reciprocally how religious studies scholarship might enrich media studies. Our primary sources are drawn from such areas as religious television, film, and radio, digital gaming worlds, billboards, advertisements and media campaigns, popular music, comedy, streaming video, social media, memes, and even tattoos, body art, and graffiti. We will look at such areas as: how religion gets mediated; the religious dimensions of transmedia storytelling and media world-building; religion as communication; online group identity formation and religious identity construction; media representation of religions; the blurred boundaries between the so-called \"sacred and the secular\" in the study of religion and media; and controversies in overlapping religious worlds and media worlds vis-à-vis the authorized and unauthorized circulation of content. Of particular interest in this course will be the impact of digital culture on the media-religion interface. Students will be asked to research and analyze a primary source of their choice and then to make their own media to communicate their original analysis and research findings. This course will involve your own creative mediamaking. Please note format: This course is a mixture of lecture and in-class participatory discussion. The professor asks provocative questions throughout class to actively engage students in the material and to invite them into sharing their points of view.",

    "overview": "Michel de Montaigne was one of the most important writers and philosophers of the early modern period; his Essais continues to be a book to live by. This seminar explores Montaigne's writings in depth, along with those of his most important interlocutors, in the context of the emergence of modern subjectivity in the period we call \"Renaissance\". Placing the distant past into conversation with the present, we will consider a set of problems relative to the constitution of the self, of the body, of cultural and gender identity, educational ideals, and political freedom. We will explore the rise of cultural norms surrounding death, love, friendship, faith, and violence. Montaigne's writings are a gateway into a turbulent and transformative period of history, one which has much to say to our own.\n\n**This class has also previously been offered as French 333.

But what does it take to perform an action together with others? When am I complicit in a collective wrong? Are groups of people capable of moral agency? How should we theorize the concept of solidarity, and does it have a role to play in combating social injustice? In this course, we will explore how to answer questions like these.",

    "overview": "Who is Jane Eyre? As one of the most iconic figures of modern womanhood in Western literary history, Jane Eyre has captivated many generations of readers around the world. A novel of brilliant idealism and forbidden love, Jane Eyre has also encouraged readers of different cultural, national, and racial identities to imagine themselves as like her, or not. How do we read this novel today, and why should we care about her almost two hundred years after her invention? How have adaptations of it over the years addressed its problematic feminism and its subtly racialized romance? In addition to Charlotte Brontë's original Jane Eyre, we will look at two novelistic adaptations of the novel, Jean Rhys's postcolonial classic Wide Sargasso Sea and Patricia Park's contemporary trans-Pacific novel Re Jane. We will also look at one film adaptation of the novel: Carey Fukunaga's brooding Jane Eyre.",

However, during this course, we will sample a variety of literary, critical, multi-media, and theoretical articulations of Black expression. At the core of our inquiry through these texts lie questions that go beyond representation and identity to think about the forms and strategies that Black folk have used to reflect and hold in question the worlds in which they navigate. The class will read primary works from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries and bring them into conversation with current and historical popular media, the extension of the tradition/s earlier artists wrote, sung, painted, struggled with and against. \n\nEXPECTATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW: Assignments will include three mini papers, discussion leading, and a fantasy course syllabus. Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments, class attendance, and participation. This seminar depends on the discussion and participation of every member of the class.",

Throughout the course, we will read texts from both central, canonical writers and more marginal, contemporary ones. Additionally, we will examine aspects of gender, sexuality, and ethnicity in Hebrew literature. Ultimately, this course will allow students to discover the beauty and richness of modern Hebrew literature. The literary works will be accompanied by films, academic articles, and theoretical texts. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel, or Judaism is required! All the Hebrew texts will be read in translation.",

    "overview": "This course explores prosody and intonation in spoken language, which relate to the grouping of words in continuous speech and pitch patterning across phrases. The course examines prosody and intonation from theoretical (formalist) and experimental (behavioral, phonetic) approaches, focusing on American English and with briefer looks at prosodic or intonational typology. Topics covered include phonological models of prosody and intonation, their acoustic phonetic correlates, the relationship between prosodic and syntactic structure, and the semantic and pragmatic functions of prosody and intonation. Additional topics will be added based on student interest, e.g., relating prosody and intonation to sociolinguistic variation, computer speech synthesis or recognition, sentence processing, discourse interactions, cognitive function, neural processing of speech, clinical populations, or music. Methods for experimental and corpus research on prosody and intonation will be emphasized.",

We'll then look at money and inflation. We'll finish with short-run macroeconomics, with a focus on the role of monetary and fiscal policy in stabilizing the business cycle. En route, time permitting, we will consider such contemporary issues as the role of economic policy in addressing environmental concerns and the recent financial crises.",

    "overview": "\"Afrofeminism\" is the label forged by a new generation of Afro-descendantwomen (mostly in their twenties and early thirties), born in Europe (often non-English-speaking), to define their black feminism to not only affirm their multiple African heritages while they live in Europe, but also to distinguish themselves from US Black Feminism. This triple gesture - linguistic, political, and cultural - calls for taking seriously the original formation and expressions of Black feminisms in diasporic and global contexts. It also implies analyzing the enduring consequences of colonialism of former European empires on the very soil of their metropoles through an intersectional perspective. This course will, therefore pay particular attention to the historical and social conditions of the emergence of black feminist struggles against patriarchy, racist minoritization and social inequality in a social and political context of white hegemony, where systemic racism is generally considered as \"a notion imported from the United States\". The reflections and readings will focus more specifically on France, a European country paradigmatic of institutionalized race denial.\nFormerly a slave-owning colonial empire still marked by massive immigration of workers from Africa, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean in the 1960s, France still maintains ambiguous political and economic ties with these territories, while it actively excludes any reference to race from its official legislation as it has made colorblindness the bedrock of its national republican ideology.",

    "overview": "Narratives are centrally important to religions. From foundational myths that create the space within which religion happens to discrete episodes that ground specific rituals, narratives are the very stuff of religion. The purpose of this course is to consider narratives as a special site for the production of religious meaning; the course will draw heavily from both religion theory and literary theory. Issues we will cover include: whether textual meaning is located in the author, text or reader; how the religious context of a narrative affects its possible interpretations; how myths and rituals comprise different modes of narrative; the relationship between narrative time and religious time; the challenge to authority inherent to much religious narrative; the variety of ways through which religious figures mobilize narrative to further their authority.\n\nThis course will utilize Jewish and Christian narratives from the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Rabbinic Literature, Apocrypha, Gnostic Texts and Church Fathers as primary texts. Students will be expected to build on materials covered in the course by applying narrative theory to the study of these narratives. Students will also learn about the near simultaneous emergence of Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism and put these two religious formations in conversation. \n\nSome of the theoretical works to be used are: Paul Ricouer, Figuring the Sacred; Roland Barthes, Mythologies; Hayden White, \"The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Reality;\" Robert Segal, ed., The Myth and Ritual Theory; Jerome Bruner, The Making of Stories; Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics; Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures; Stanley Fish, Is There a Text in This Class?",

With this in mind, the textbook is supplemented by additional printed and audio-visual materials provided by the instructor.\nTurkish 111-3, taught in the Spring Quarter, is the third and final quarter of first-year Turkish. The course builds on material learned in the first two quarters by introducing additional grammar and fundamental sentence structures, by presenting new vocabulary, and by providing students ample opportunities to practice and expand all skills. We will continue to use texts and audio centered around topics in Elementary Turkish I and II as well as work with additional printed audio and video material provided by the instructor. The course covers Unites 16-19 Elementary Turkish II. We will also watch a new TV show to practice our language skills and improve our understanding of Turkish culture and history.",

We will develop reading and writing skills using Modern Standard Arabic and speaking and listening skills using an educated spoken version of the āmmiyya of the Levantine dialect. The integrated approach successfully teaches the reality of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the various settings and contexts of the Arab world. The course will enhance learners' ability to read, write, understand, and discuss challenging authentic texts from different sources. \n \nThis quarter, we will continue to use Arabiyyat al-Naas (Part Two, second edition) focusing on new useful vocabulary and phrases to communicate in a real-life context. Students will learn about the modern Arab world and its history and economy, culture and language. Different media tools will be used such as games, crosswords, songs, movies, interviews, and documentaries about the Arab world. \n \nIn the Spring Quarter, we will cover Unit 15 (festivals and Celebrations), Unit 16 (lMigrationa and Refugees), Unit 17 (The Environment), Unit 18 (Marriage).",

Although concepts of biology, biochemistry, pharmacy, physiology, and pharmacology will be discussed, it is principally an organic chemistry course with the emphasis on physical interactions and chemical reactions and their mechanisms as applied to biological systems. We will see how drugs are discovered and developed; how they get to their site of action; what happens when they reach the site of action in their interaction with receptors, enzymes, and DNA; how resistance occurs; how the body gets rid of drugs, and what a medicinal chemist can do to avoid having the body eliminate them before they have produced their desired effect. The approaches discussed are those used in the pharmaceutical industry and elsewhere for the discovery of new drugs.",

    "overview": "It's hard to imagine modern alternative culture—the queer aesthetics of the goth 1980s, the drugged-up industrial 1990s, or even Matty Healy of The 1975's swaggering claim that his style is \"black and expensive\"—without its roots in the fashionable decadent movement of the late nineteenth century. In 1891, four years before his trial for sodomy and indecency, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray shocked the Victorian public with its seductive exploration of queer sensuality, decadence, indulgence, and drug use. What is it about Wilde's rallying cry of \"art for art's sake\" that was so transgressive? As a survey of nineteenth-century decadent and aesthetic literature, this course unpacks the seedier, darker side of the stiffly corseted Victorians and their cultural afterlives. We will explore key canonical works by authors including Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Henry James, and recover important aesthetic fantasies by lesser-known writers. Over the course of this class, students will build a foundational understanding of aesthetic theory and learn to interrogate texts through queer and postcolonial frameworks. In addition to reading key Victorian texts, students will unpack Romantic precedents and the ways that these distinctly nineteenth-century preoccupations with decay, degeneracy, and transgression influenced and shaped counterculture through the present day.",

How can a nation remember and retell obscured histories of violence, reconcile past violence, and resist future violence? What does it mean that lynching emerged as a category in the same historical moment as the Bill of Rights, and that certain kinds of violence have been central to American identity? \n\nThe story of the United States is built on the inclusion or omission of violence: from the genocide of Native Americans to slavery to imperial conquest, from \"private\" pain of women to the nationalized pain of soldiers. This lecture course brings violence to the center of U.S. history. Moving from Early America to the present, we will discuss these overlapping stories in terms of their visibility and invisibility, addressing questions of representation and the haunting function of traumatic experience. Following an emerging subfield of scholarship in Histories of Violence, this course examines narrative, archival, and political issues around studying, teaching, and writing such stories.",

Through close study of individual artworks, students will learn how to analyze works of art as products of their particular social, political, and historical contexts. Along the way, students will study the major historical forces that shaped the evolution of European art during this period, including the wars of religion, the establishment of royal art academies, the rise of the art market and the art critic, and the expansion of trade and colonialism in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students will also consider the roles of gender, race, sexuality, and class in the development of European art.",

    "overview": "The field of disability studies grew out of the rights-based activism that led, in the United States, to the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Yet, as disability theorists have observed, \"western\" literature has long been obsessed with disability as metaphor, character trait, and plot device. This course will serve as an introduction to the application of disability studies in literature. We will explore a range of questions: how do we approach the representation of disability in texts by non-disabled authors? How do we differentiate (or should we?) between disability and chronic illness, or between physical and mental disabilities? Can literary representation operate as activism? How do we parse the gap between disability as metaphor and lived experience? What does literature offer disability studies, and why should disability studies be a core method for studying literature?  Readings will be divided between theoretical texts and primary sources. Students will learn to grapple with complex sociocultural and literary analysis, as well as to make space for their own primary source readings.",

    "overview": "The Spanish nun Saint Teresa of Avila was in her thirties when she began to levitate during her ecstatic trances. \"She dearly wished not to be considered a saint,\" a fellow nun recalled after her death, \"so she constantly begged me and her other daughters to pull down hard on her vestments whenever we saw her rising into the air.\" The attempted concealment was futile, however; Saint Teresa's extraordinary spiritual gifts - and otherworldly humility - gained her instant fame and established a model for religious women that lasted throughout the rest of the early modern era. \n\nAt a time in which women's social roles were severely circumscribed, religious women and female religious communities flourished across Europe. Early modern women levitated, bilocated [appeared in two places at once], experienced visions, battled with the devil, wrote autobiographies, and pioneered religious missions around the world. Working within traditions and cultures that subordinated them to men, some religious women carved out relatively independent lives devoted to charity, teaching, and prayer (occasionally gaining fame, fortune, and notoriety along the way). This course will explore the lives and experiences of women of Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faith within both Europe and European colonies in the Americas and Asia. Together we will engage with the cultural, theological, liturgical, social, and political factors which shaped women's spirituality from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries.",

We will begin by focusing on the case of Italy, which has often been described as the \"political laboratory\" of the old continent, if not of the West at large. Our working thesis is that the massive convergence of economic and political interests in the careers of Silvio Berlusconi and Donald Trump, both business tycoons turned political leaders, cannot be properly understood without attending to issues of gender and sexuality. We will then expand our inquiry to the case of the United States and, in particular, to the role that intersectionality (here as in Italy) plays in our understanding of both past predicaments and future possibilities.",

    "overview": "Mimesis names a relation of likeness: the way a work of art of literature is like something else—not the only way, but a uniquely central way in theories of representation in the traditions of Europe and the Mediterranean.  Since Plato and Aristotle, mimesis has often stood for a kind of natural relation of one thing to another.  It thus paradoxically is a relation that often goes without saying: you are supposed to recognize likeness when you see it.  This course will explore some of the things that literature is supposed to be like (action? the world? other literature?), but also what it means for one thing to be said to be like another thing at all.  We will balance theoretical discussions of mimesis with theatrical and other explorations of its role, as well as strategies for representation besides likeness, representing things that are like nothing, and hierarchies implied or subverted by the concept of mimesis.  Readings might include selections from Aristotle, Longinus, Shakespeare, Corneille, Calderon, Cavendish, Freud, Woolf, Warburg, Benjamin, Auerbach, Wittgenstein, Capote, Latour, Bhabha, Ranciere, Viveiros de Castro, or Hartman.",

    "overview": "What is the single most obvious and significant thing that can be said about the US, even with a rudimentary knowledge of US history, which is the least remarked upon, least analysed, and least studied, and yet without it, the US as we understand today would not exist as we know it? The answer is ‘whiteness'. Whiteness as a word and concept can be difficult and troubling to understand for some. In this course whiteness refers to three phenomena: First, the dominant representation of people in the US who historically came to describe and understand themselves as ‘white' on the basis of exploiting, violating, segregating, oppressing, administrating, marginalizing and caricaturing those designated as ‘non-white' (e.g. Black, Native American, Asian, Latinx). Second, the hegemonic cultural norms identified as white in ruling the institutions, governments, laws, ideas, policies of the US that assume and support the sovereign dominance, rights and authority of white populations over non-white populations. Third, the inheritance and acceptance of white ruling culture (e.g. white supremacy, white privilege) as normative; and (in the post-civil rights era), the denial that whiteness exists, together with opposition to any attempts to highlight, expose or discuss it. This course will discuss whiteness in historical, political, cultural and visual terms and also present conceptual tools for the analysis of whiteness as a dominant formation.",

    "overview": "This graduate seminar explores the relationship between art and imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries, with a focus on the art and architecture of the French and Ottoman empires. Rather than prioritize processes of cultural exchange, this seminar takes the various revolutions (political, social, economic) that defined this period of global history as a transcultural framework for examining the co-evolution of French and Ottoman art. This seminar combines deep analysis of individual artworks with historical and theoretical readings from disciplines outside of art history, including postcolonial studies, feminist theory, queer theory, comparative literature, and MENA studies. In addition to studying established frameworks for analyzing Franco-Ottoman art history (such as Orientalism), this seminar also explores new approaches for writing transcultural art histories at the intersection of revolution and empire. \n\nThis seminar will be of interest to students of art and imperialism, modern French and Ottoman cultural history, Orientalism, and revolutionary politics and aesthetics. Students are welcome to write their final research paper on any topic that touches on these themes.",

    "overview": "AY25 IN A DIVIDED COUNTRY: LITERATURE AND THE ARTS IN COLD WAR KOREA AND BEYOND\nThis course examines how the Cold War division of the Korean Peninsula has shaped art, cultural representations, and cultural politics from 1945 to the present. Through the analysis of literature, film, visual art, and popular media, we explore how artists, writers, and ordinary people in both South and North Korea have navigated ideological boundaries, trauma, and national identity under the constraints of state censorship, Cold War-era politics, and global superpower influence. Focusing on themes of division, collective memory, and reunification, the course investigates how creative works not only engage with historical and contemporary realities but also use imagination to reflect on the past, present, and future of both the nation and the world. While providing a broad overview of Korean arts since the division, the course also examines contemporary works—including popular K-dramas—that reimagine separation and reunification in new and thought-provoking ways.",

It will trace the story of how Rome as a small city state in central Italy, on the periphery of the older civilizations of the Near East and Greece, established military and political control over Italy; how it built a Mediterranean empire and administered it for centuries; how a long period of decline led to to the partition of its empire into an eastern and western half; and finally how the western half collapsed. In addition to this chronological narrative, the course will treat several key themes and concepts in Roman culture. The Roman military will receive attention, as will gender relations and public spectacles. Roman religion and the role of slavery will also be discussed.",

    "overview": "French 493 Topics in Literary Theory: The Politics of Aesthetics\n\nThis course will explore three approaches to the problem of \"the politics of aesthetics\" in dialogue with literary and cinematic works. We will begin with the Frankfurt School tradition, where that politics is conceived in terms of a logic of mediation (as elaborated in the criticism of such figures as Georg Lukàcs, Walter Benjamin, and Fredric Jameson). We will then turn to Jacques Rancière's rethinking of the politics of aesthetics in terms of a dissensual logic of equality—a logic which is developed not only in Rancière's readings of canonical literary works, but also in his discussions of the poetics of history and the dissensual literary practice of proletarian writers.  We will then consider Gilles Deleuze's thought on art, cinema and literature, beginning with his books on Marcel Proust and Francis Bacon, before moving on to a discussion of those of his writings where the problem of aesthetic politics comes to the fore—notably, in his collaborative work with Félix Guattari and in his writings on film, as well as in his reframing of the problem of the politics of form (where \"the visible\" and \"the sayable\" are thought as \"formalizations\" of relations of force) in dialogue with the work of Michel Foucault. Over the course of these discussions, we will engage with the writings of such authors as Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, Jules Michelet, Gustave Flaubert, and Assia Djebar, as well as with the films of such directors as Sergei Eisenstein, Jean Renoir, Kidlat Tahimik, Assia Djebar, Ridley Scott, Jean-Luc Godard, Antonia Byrd, and Abderrahmane Sissako. The major project for this course will be a conference paper on a text or film drawn from the student's research interests beyond the cinematic and literary corpus assigned. This course will be taught in English, with readings available in both French and English.",

    "overview": "This course examines the Holocaust of European Jews from its origins through its aftermath in the context of Nazi Germany's murderous campaigns against other groups of victims, including disabled persons, sexual minorities, Roma, and Slavs. We will read first-hand accounts and analyze primary documents written by victims and perpetrators as we seek to understand the causes, course, and consequences of the genocidal policies of Germany and its Axis allies. From Vichy France in the West to the occupied Soviet territories in the East, the persecution, expropriation, and murder of millions necessitated the participation of countless civilians and state officials. With a special focus on Eastern Europe, where the greatest number of Jews lived and nearly all of the murdered died, we will explore questions of local complicity, the motives of perpetrators and of those who sought to impede them, and the responses of the continent's Jews and other victims to the onslaught. The course will conclude with postwar efforts to punish the Holocaust's perpetrators, to commemorate its victims, and to deny that genocide was even committed.",

    "overview": "The Victorian Era was one of the most influential periods in not just British history, but the history of the modern world. Between 1780 and 1900, the British Isles transformed from a small island nation of the coast of Europe to the heart of an empire that claim to a quarter of the world's land and population. This expansion not only changed Britain itself, but spread political structures, Victorian culture, and British settlers around the world. This course explores how and why Britain came to \"rule the waves\" over the nineteenth century, along with considering what everyday life was like for people both in Britain and in the Empire. It also considers the legacy of the Victorian era in both historical structures and cultural memory.",

    "overview": "Our climate is rapidly changing. Rising sea levels and increasing ocean acidity, higher temperatures, more droughts, melting glaciers, wilder weather patterns, and mounting environmental disasters mean that climate change is increasingly visible in our daily lives. What role does human society play in these changes, and what consequences does society suffer as these changes occur? This course is an introduction to environmental sociology during which we will employ an intersectional, sociological perspective to look beyond the scientific basis for environmental problems to understand the social roots of environmental issues. We will cover a variety of topics in environmental sociology, including how actors such as corporations, the media, and social movements impact public opinion and environmental issues. Further, we will critically examine the gendered, racial, and socioeconomic production of disparate environmental risks. A primary, central focus of this sociology course is environmental inequality, and students engage with a wide range of theories to examine environmental issues of their own choosing. This is not a public policy course. \n\nThis course is taught with ENVR_POL 212-0-20",

    "overview": "An encyclopedic epic that tracks three Dubliners' criss-crossing adventures on 16 June 1904, James Joyce's landmark Ulysses (1922) captures a day in the life of a semicolonial city in a wealth of analytic--in his word, vivisective--detail. Proposing that Ulysses has much to teach us about how to read our own everyday worlds, we'll study the book's eighteen episodes alongside Homer's Odyssey and other sources, notes, and commentaries. In thinking about the fictional Dubliners who populate Ulysses, we'll consider: Joyce's transmutation of the Odyssey into a modern epic quest; Ireland's long colonial history and its struggle to throw off British rule; characters' conflicting dreams of a subject or sovereign Ireland; conditions of home, exile, and homecoming; psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious and the psychopathology of everyday life (Freud); scapegoat dynamics in theory and everyday practice; bodies, sensation, food, peristalsis, hunger, sex, birth, death; desire, the gaze, gender, gesture, dress, and social power; performance and theatricality, both studied and unconscious; the pain and mourning of loss; the power of love; the scalpel of wit; the social life— and political bite--of jokes, comedy, satire, humor; the socio-economic sex/gender system, including marriage and prostitution, as key to political authority in light of Joyce's reported remark that women's emancipation is \"the greatest revolution of our time in the most important relationship there is\"; intersubjective dynamics, human and animal, dead and alive; history, time, memory, monuments; the burdens, powers, and pleasures of language; the play of voices: narrative voice, interior monologue, dialogue, colloquy, reported speech, telling silences, omniscient authority, poetry, news, advertising, jokes, parody, obfuscation, song, music, play script, letters, catechism, allusion, citation; noises and soundscapes from the cat's \"mrkgnao\" to a screeching tram and characters' inner, speaking, and singing voices; the worldly diction of Joyce's beyond-English; and more. We'll approach this challenging, maddening, amazing, exhilarating, funny, moving, deeply rewarding, often life-changing book in ways playful and critical, jocoserious and analytic; and we'll seek revelation by reading, thinking, and discussing it together with serious purpose and imaginative freedom.",

    "overview": "International organizations are designed to facilitate cooperation between states, addressing problems and issues that affect all nations, the global commons and humanity in general. But for the goals of international organizations to be achieved, usually a change of domestic policy is needed. This seminar examines the questions of if, when and how international actors influence a state to change its policy so as to promote objectives of international institutions and altruistic or self-interested actors. We also examine why international institutions so often fall short, and the experience of communities that are on the receiving end of international ‘help.\n\nThe course includes policy memos and three class presentations. The memos and presentations feed directly into the final research project.",

Even though it was believed that one could encounter the gods anywhere, some places were more sacred than others, and over time the concept of a sanctuary formed. This course will investigate sacred spaces in the ancient Mediterranean, with a focus on Greece and Rome. We will ask: what made one place more sacred than others? What activities and rituals occurred in a sanctuary? How can we recognize a sanctuary archaeologically, and how were they discussed in ancient literature? By investigating ancient sacred spaces, students will explore the social, political, and economic realities and imaginations of religious spaces as they effected polities, empires, and interconnected cultures.",

A central goal of the class is to develop tools for approaching literary texts as creative expressions as well as challenging reflections on society, power, knowledge, and difference.  The millennium-long sweep of English 210 will help us approach literature not as escapist leisure but as social thought expressed in new representational modes.  We will pay special attention to the role of transoceanic travel, exploitation, and mercantile capitalist trade in the development of English literary forms.  At a time of unprecedented encounters with other peoples and places, how did English literary forms represent—and contest—these new realities?",

Organized chronologically, the course highlights the social, political, cultural, and intellectual forces, key figures, and organizations that shaped the early African American experience. Special attention is given to the role of gender in shaping experiences of slavery, white supremacy, patriarchy, and resistance to this oppression. Additionally, the course investigates how the legacies of slavery, sexual violence, systemic discrimination, and labor exploitation have contributed to many challenges faced by African Americans and black people in America today. Finally, it reveals how foundational ideas of freedom, resistance, rebellion, and self-determination emerged from the early experiences of Africans in America.",

Migration might be voluntary and economic—in search of a better life—or forced and political—simply to save one's life. Some were motivated by commerce, conquest, or religion. Others simply wandered and recorded their new experiences. Today, movement is both easier and hindered by language, documents, terrain, technology, governments, etc.  In this course, we will investigate migration, travel, and movement to explore its consequences from a number of different perspectives in Latin American and Latinx Studies.",

Taking as our starting point the end of the (federal) constitutional right to abortion in the U.S. in 2022, we consider arguments concerning its significance within North American law and politics. We also engage trans-border and further perspectives contributed by an international outlook. The course offers an introduction to a cross-disciplinary area of study: we will encounter arguments from a range of fields such as legal studies, political and media theory, Black studies and decolonial thought, history, philosophical theories of biopower, and activist dimensions. We will consider the development in both national and trans-national contexts of different paradigms including intersectionality, reproductive justice, the politics of collective care, and the plural activisms of Latin America's \"green wave\" movements.",

We will get off to a gentle start by exploring predicate logic with identity. Then we will turn to understanding modal logic, which can be built on top of both propositional logic and predicate logic. Towards the end of the quarter, we will explore predicate logic with types.",

Topics will include, but are not limited to, the contribution of these communities to digestion and gut health, mood, obesity, the immune system, fertility and pregnancy, and neurological disorders. This is a rapidly expanding field, and we will place a special emphasis on exploring these topics through review of primary research articles.",

Surveys from the Corporation for National and Community Service reveal that volunteering is associated with a 30% higher likelihood of employment. Companies are 80% more likely to choose candidates with volunteering experience. However, college students are less likely to volunteer compared to their parents and high school students. This seminar will explore the numerous benefits of volunteering within our local community. Through community service, students will gain real-world experience and develop valuable skills while making a positive impact on others' lives. Working with nonprofit organizations provides first-year students an excellent opportunity to explore career paths and enhance their time-management skills. Additionally, college students who volunteer in their local communities often feel happier and experience a greater sense of belonging. Students are required to complete an 8-hour community volunteering project.",

    "overview": "This seminar introduces students to the growing subfield of queer and transgender studies in religion. Combining theoretical frameworks from religious studies and queer and transgender studies, we will study the impact of religious norms on queer/trans lives within religious communities, queer/trans forms of religion that emerge on the margins of normative religious communities, and when queerness/transness become points of religious exit. We will explore the norming systems of religion and gender/sex/sexuality together, examining how they produce both normative and non-normative forms of embodiment and desire, while interrogating the boundaries of religion/race/ethnicity. Crucial to our study will be the examination of the language and categories of \"queer\" \"trans\" and \"religious\" as social identities and structural subject positions. Where do these terms originate and who do they include? Do they articulate forms of identity, practice, belief, or power? And how do we trace the boundaries of normativity in a transnational, transhistorical, and comparative ethnoreligious context?",

All-powerful, authoritarian kingdoms and state and/or corporate powers abound in the many genres of speculative fiction—from sci-fi to fantasy, from dystopian to horror. But how do they relate to our contemporary moment and history? This class examines how empires are conceived and constructed and what roles race and gender play in their creation. Linking the history of U.S. empire building across the hemisphere with contemporary popular media and the works of Latinx and Indigenous authors and filmmakers, we'll ask: how are empires built? What purposes do they serve? How do they construct (and deconstruct) the meanings of race and gender? And finally, how does speculative fiction envision alternative futures? Texts and media may include selections from Helena María Viramontes' The Moths, Vanessa Angélica Villareal's Magical/ Realism, Cherie Dimaline's The Marrow Thieves, Andor, Game of Thrones, and The Last of Us.",

    "overview": "Negotiation is at the heart of politics. From peace processes, to budget reconciliation, to international treaties on human rights, climate, and trade, high-stakes political negotiations require actors to work through their differences. You, too, are engaged in negotiation any time you need others' cooperation to get what you want.  How should people resolve their differences? In this course, students will learn about the theory and practice of negotiation and conflict resolution. Through active learning about the substance and process of negotiating, students will learn how to craft creative solutions with a focus on interests, options, alternatives, relationships, communication, criteria, and commitment. Throughout the course, students will participate in simulation exercises and will be evaluated on their preparation, execution, and reflection from each exercise. We will tackle positional and principled negotiation, hard bargainers, cross-cultural negotiation, and multi-party negotiation. Beyond theory and practice, this course focuses on application: students will explore and assess real-world case studies from international and domestic politics. At the end of the course, students will draw on course lessons to evaluate a real-world political negotiation of their choosing. Success in this course requires active participation, innovative thinking, and the willingness to leave your comfort zone behind.

She has recently completed research at the ancient Maya farming community of Chan in Belize, Central America which was occupied for 2000 years from 800 BC to AD 1200 (http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/subfields/archaeology/chan/index.html). The people who lived at Chan were ordinary farmers and the goal of research at Chan is to explore the importance of farmers¿ everyday lives. Starting in summer 2015, she is embarking on a new research project at the ancient Maya city of Aventura, also in Belize. Aventura is a city that survived the Maya collapse and may hold answers to how humans can create sustainable cities.",

    "overview": "AY25 TRANSFORMING SEOUL: FROM IMPERIAL PERIPHERY TO GLOBAL SMART CITY\nSince the late 19th century, Seoul has undergone a profound transformation, connecting its historical past to the forces of global urbanization. This course examines the city's modern and contemporary development through the lens of Marxist urban theory, analyzing how Seoul continuously produces new spaces to sustain global capitalist accumulation. A key focus of the course is the relationship between urbanization and cultural representation, drawing on Fredric Jameson's concept of \"geopolitical aesthetics\" to explore how literature, film, and media register the evolving social and economic landscape. By tracing the circulation of commodities, labor, and capital, we will consider how Seoul's history reflects broader global processes, including colonialism, Cold War nation-state formation, and post-Fordist globalization. Through interdisciplinary readings in urban studies, critical media studies, literary and film analysis, and cultural theory, students will gain a deeper understanding of Seoul's urban transformation and its significance within the wider context of planetary urbanization.",

This course traces its evolution from 19th-century crime writing to modern investigative journalism, films, TV shows, podcasts, and online communities. We'll explore how True Crime balances storytelling, ethics, and activism—sometimes sensationalizing crime, other times exposing flaws in the justice system. Through critical academic and pop cultural readings, we will examine the genre's legal, ethical, and social ramifications, questioning why True Crime captivates audiences and how it impacts our understanding of justice.",

    "overview": "\"Sociology of Immigration\"\n\nThis graduate seminar examines the dynamics of migration both from the perspective of the receiving society and from the lived experiences of migrants themselves. This course will introduce students to major theories, topics, and debates in the field of immigration with a focus on three core areas: integration and exclusion; borders and transnationalism; and citizenship and crimmigration. Throughout the course we will be attentive to the overlap between race and immigration as both scholarly areas and political imperatives and engage critical legal studies perspectives to ground our understanding of the production of immigration law. Because this is a graduate sociology course, we will also consider the genealogy of immigration as a subfield of sociology, as well as some of the key debates surrounding the study of immigration across the social sciences. While this class will focus primarily on the U.S. context from the 20th century to the contemporary period, we will also be in conversation with historical and comparative approaches to understanding immigration.",

    "overview": "In a famous note to the first section of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Kant remarks that \"only the Germans\" persist in associating the notion of \"aesthetics\" with the \"criticism of taste.\" He argues that this is based on the \"false hope […] of bringing the judgment of the beautiful under rational principles. […] It would be advisable, therefore, to drop the name in that sense […]\" Scarcely ten years later, in his Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant grudgingly revises his view and seeks precisely to construe \"the faculty of taste (Geschmacksvermögen) as an aesthetic power of judgment\" from a \"transcendental point of view\" (in transzendentaler Absicht). In so doing, Kant acknowledges that the major challenge to defining a transcendental principle of aesthetic judgment consists in its \"immediate relation [to] feelings of pleasure and displeasure.\" How the immediacy of this relation might derive from a principle that is neither psychological nor empirical, but transcendental and a priori, constitutes the enigma -- \"das Rätselhafte\" - that his Critique seeks to resolve. \n\nBut Kant had no illusions concerning \"the great difficulty involved in resolving a problem that nature has rendered so complex (verwickelt hat).\"   I suggest that nothing less is involved in this \"complexity\" than the task of rethinking the way singularities - events that don't conform to established general schemes - can be communicated and shared. Which is to say, encountered and experienced collectively. The seminar will retrace the contours and trajectory of Kant's response to this encounter with the singular, through a close reading of the first part of Kant's Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment. In the process, the interdependence of knowing and feeling will be reexamined in relation to a notion that plays no obvious role in Kant's lexicon (although it will later for Freud), namely, tension.",

    "overview": "\"Afrofeminism\" is the label forged by a new generation of Afrodescendant women (mostly in their twenties and early thirties), born in Europe (often non-English-speaking), to define their black feminism to not only affirm their multiple African heritages while they live in Europe, but also to distinguish themselves from US Black Feminism. This triple gesture - linguistic, political and cultural - calls for taking seriously the original formation and expressions of Black feminisms in diasporic and global contexts. It also implies to analyze the enduring consequences of colonialism of former European empires on the very soil of their metropoles through an intersectional perspective. \n\nIn this sense, this course will pay attention to the historical and social conditions of the emergence of black feminist struggles against patriarchy, racist minoritization and social inequality in a social and political context of white hegemony, where systemic racism is generally considered as \"a notion imported from the United States\". The reflections and readings will mainly focus on France, a European country which is paradigmatic of institutionalized race denial. Formerly a slave-owning colonial empire still marked by massive immigration of workers from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean in the 1960s, France still maintains ambiguous political and economic ties with these territories, while it actively excludes any reference to race from its official legislation as it has made colorblindness the bedrock of its national republicanism. However, some material will address the topic of Afrofeminism in a broader European context.",

Using interdisciplinary research with a focus on sociological studies, we will interrogate the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss health inequalities between women, men, and trans* people from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, using sociological research to understand why these inequalities and forms of difference emerge and are sustained. We will explore how modern Western medicine views male and female bodies and defines their health and illnesses accordingly. Students will complete two short research projects over the term in which they use different data sources (interviews and media content) to examine gendered perceptions of health, health behaviors, help-seeking behaviors, and experiences with medical institutions.\n\nThis course is taught with GNDR_ST 332-0-20.",

    "overview": "Why is it so hard to argue without crying? Why do you suck at doing something as soon as you have an audience? Can humans be truly \"rational\"? We typically think of cognitive processes (e.g., thinking, deciding, recalling) as being distinct from emotional processes (e.g., feeling, expressing). However, very rarely do these processes explain human behavior in the absence of the other's influence. In this course, we will complicate our understanding of cognition and emotion by exploring some of the many real-world, everyday experiences that can only be explained at the intersection of the two processes. Through readings, in-class discussions, and out-of-class activities and exercises, we will explore a wide array of everyday phenomena (e.g., choking under pressure, lying, shopping) that span different developmental periods (e.g., childhood, adolescence, the elderly), contexts (e.g. school performance, jury duty, social media), and populations (e.g., clinical vs. nonclinical). To understand human behavior, we will take a truly interdisciplinary approach - drawing from a vast literature both within psychology (e.g., social, developmental, cognitive, political, and educational psychology) and across disciplines (e.g., law, health communications, consumer marketing). Ultimately, our discussions, readings, and exercises will equip us to better understand how and why we conduct ourselves the way we do. Course readings will include journal articles and select chapters from popular press books. There is no required textbook. This is a discussion heavy class-you will be expected to co-lead a discussion and submit a group final presentation as part of this class.",

The second half of the first quarter discussed simple applications relevant to electrons in metals, including the effect of external fields, two-particle interactions, impurity scattering, ensemble averaging and calculations of conductivity. \n\nThe second quarter will start with superfluidity in liquid 4He if it was not covered at the end of the first quarter.  We will then move on to superconductivity, the development of the nonequilibrium (Keldysh) Green's function technique and the quasiclassical approximation, with specific applications in disordered superconductors.",

The 2024 election, the 2020 Census, the border, Hispanic\nHeritage Month, depictions in popular culture. There's so much to say!\nThe growth of the Latino population has transformed the United States and has led to heightened\ndebates about their political power, cultural influence, citizenship, civil rights, and ethnic and\nracial categorization. Yet many Americans still don't really understand who Latinos are—or who\nLatinos have been and will become.\nWhile the increased attention to Latinos may feel \"new,\" Latino communities have played a\npivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of\nLatinos in the United States—and across the Americas—from the 16th century through the early\n21st century.\nIn its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses\non race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community—or several\ncommunities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central\nAmericans, Cuban Americans, and others—that represents a growing percentage of the U.S.\npopulation as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture,\nand economy of the United States.\nAlthough we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino\npeoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a\nvariety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical\ninterpretations. Ultimately, students will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories\nthat bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial\nclassification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their\nhistories.",

    "overview": "Based on a Real Story: Latin American True Crime\n\nCrime fascinates. Sociologists, historians, and literary critics have long tried to understand why narratives of crime hold such allure for the multitudes of people who consume them in the form of books, weekly podcasts, Netflix specials, videoessays, feature-length films, as well as contemporary art exhibits. However, if fictional stories of crime fascinate, narratives that purport to tell a true story fascinate even more so. The course will explore the history of True Crime as a genre in Latin America through the analysis of a diverse group of cultural artifacts and literary works from two countries: Brazil and Argentina. In the class we will discuss materials ranging from novels (Piglia, Lins, Almada) and films (Aïnouz, Piñeyro) to photographs, podcasts, sensationalistic tabloid articles, and even digitized archival criminal case files. At the center of our discussions will be the question: What truth do these narratives of crime hold and for whom?\n\nThe class will be taught in English and the course materials will be available both in English translation as well as in the original Spanish and Portuguese.",

But because these ideas are both exciting and important, new approaches are constantly emerging --- and that state of affairs is likely to continue!

We will aim to examine each of these aspects using a range of tools, holistically building a better understanding of how the subsurface works in it's natural state and how this may change moving forward.

    "overview": "Course title: Othering and Otherness in Israeli Film\t\n\nSince its inception, Israeli society is comprised of various and different social groups; immigrants, Arabs, Jews, foreign workers, religious people, secular people, ultra-orthodox Jews, Christians, to name several. In a society where many feel themselves as outsiders, how do social norms apply and is there actually something such as \"social norms\"? Or perhaps there are social norms within each group of \"others\"? What happens when social norms of a certain group clash with what is supposedly the social norms of \"Israeli society\"? And is there an actual entity of \"Israeli society\" or is it only imagined by those who seek to be part of it? Film in its nature is an introspective tool, and in the case of Israeli film it has always been a prism through which Israeli directors examine questions of identity, the treatment of \"others\", and the relationship between the center and the margins. In this class we will watch various Israeli films that relate to the notion of otherness and to the dilemmas that arise from the characters' complex position in Israeli society. Among the movies we will watch are \"Borrowed Identity\", \"The Matchmaker\", \"Sandstorm\" and \"Baba Joon\". We will read texts that will contextualize the movies and will shed light on the stance of otherness in Israeli society. No previous knowledge of Hebrew or Israel or Israeli cinema is required. All the movies will have English subtitles and all the readings will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions.",

Moving beyond the conventional narrative of rivalry, violence, and conflict, we adopt a Relational History approach to uncover a richer and more nuanced understanding of this contested period. Focusing on interactions that extended beyond political tensions, we will examine shared identities, joint experiences, and daily encounters that shaped relations between Arabs and Jews. Topics include collaborations in mixed cities, the education system, business and labor markets, political organizations, leisure venues, and more. We will also delve into communal, personal and, at times, even romantic relationships that developed amidst the growing national struggle. Using primary historical sources, this course invites students to critically analyze how Jews and Arabs navigated their everyday lives in diverse public spheres, shedding light on an often-overlooked dimension of their shared history.",

    "overview": "This seminar asks, what does the study of modernism look like now, in 2025? Modernism in the visual arts is usually described as a phenomenon that began in Europe sometime after 1850 and came to an end at some contested date around 1970, with the advent of a broadly defined post-modernism. Yet this timeline is highly Euro-American- and capital-centric. Modernist art, as a response to modernity, happened—and perhaps continues to happen—at different times in different parts of the globe and under different political regimes, like socialism. This course will examine defining texts on modernism, including more recent decolonial accounts that decenter modernism (e.g., Partha Mitter). It will also examine recent key books on modernism in art (such as Joshua I. Cohen's The \"Black Art\" Renaissance: African Sculpture and Modernism across Continents, Stephen S. Lee's The Ethnic Avant-Garde, Anna Arabindan-Kesson's Black Bodies White Gold, and my own Collective Body: Aleksandr Deineka at the Limit of Socialist Realism), which demonstrate the current state of the field and allow us to imagine the possible futures of modernist study from the perspective of our current predicament.",

Despite popular narratives of the Midwest as purely a heartland of white homogeneity and normativity, racialized communities of color have long shaped politics, culture, and society in the region. This course emphasizes the fluid nature of ideas about race, and their interplay with the construction of place in a settler colonial society. The course materials cover a wide range of topics that are crucial for understanding both Midwestern and U.S. history writ large. From the multi-ethnic world of the fur trade, to contemporary housing inequalities, this course highlights the making of a U.S. region, and confronts mythologies of the Midwest in the American imagination.",

Among the topics to be covered will be \"reclaimed epithets\" (e.g. \"dyke\" and \"queer\"), gender vs. sexuality vs. sex, coming-out stories as gay genre, the sexual lexicon, cross-cultural sexual diversity, and the general role of language in creating, reifying, and reproducing sexual categories, identities, and intimacy.",

    "overview": "\"Counter Intelligence for Civil Society: A Deep Dive into the Citizen Lab\"\nThis course is an intensive examination of the evolving terrain of global digital electronic telecommunications through the lens of the research of the Citizen Lab. For over 20  years, the Citizen Lab -- an interdisciplinary research laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto (which the instructor founded and currently directs) -- has investigated issues at the intersection of information and communication technologies, human rights, and global security. We use a \"mixed methods\" approach to research combining practices from political science, law, computer science, engineering, and area studies. We see ourselves as a kind of \"early warning system,\" looking over the horizon, or peering beneath the covers of the technological systems that surround us, to expose abuses of power, violations of human rights, or other threats to privacy and security. The Citizen Lab is a pioneer in a new and growing field of \"digital accountability\" research.\nAfter setting the stage with some general readings on background and context, we turn to several modules organized as detailed examinations of the Citizen Lab's mixed methods research on information controls, including analyzing Internet and social media censorship and surveillance, investigating targeted digital espionage, and analyzing the harms and consequences of growing digital transnational repression. We conclude with an exploration of threat modeling and how each of you can improve your own digital hygiene.",

    "overview": "The cities buried by Mt Vesuvius hold an undying place in the modern imagination. Tourists marvel at the size of the sites and empathize with the plight of the towns' inhabitants. However, Campania's destroyed cities have more to offer than the story of the 79 AD volcanic eruption. Rather than present a static picture of Campania's towns as \"frozen in time,\" this course takes a diachronic approach to the rich archaeological material. Campania was not originally Roman territory and was conquered by force of arms. Pompeii, often seen as an archetypal Roman town, was not Roman at all for most of its existence. Still, at the time of the eruption Campania's cities had been thoroughly Romanized; they are now famous for the evidence they provide for Roman daily life. This course will survey key aspects of the evidence, as well as current archaeological techniques and fieldwork. The course will also discuss the 18th and 19th century uncovering of Campania's cities, which is a story in its own right.",

    "overview": "The utopian tradition plays a significant role in the emergence of the novel in the eighteenth century. Novels often include embedded utopias within them, so much so that these might be considered a \"chronotope\" of the early novel. On the face of it, this is paradoxical. Utopias portray visions of idealized societies, while novels operate in the mode of a critical realism scrutinizing the present. In this class, we will try to understand the place of utopian thinking in eighteenth-century novels.  Are utopianism and realism at odds in the early novel? Does the critical potential of realism need the normative guidance of utopian thought to be effective? Why do embedded utopias become more scarce in later novels, and how is realism able to get along without them?\n\nThis class will read an array of early novels with embedded utopias. (Possibilities include: Cervantes, Don Quixote; Swift, Gulliver's Travels (book 4); Mandeville, Fable of the Bees; Fielding, Joseph Andrews; Rousseau, Julie; Goethe, Wilhelm Meister; Jane Austen, Persuasion; Mary Shelley, Frankenstein.) We will also read a selection of early utopias such as More's Utopia and Bacon's New Atlantis. Alongside these texts, we will read contemporary critical writing about utopias (Bloch, Jameson), realism (Watt, Lukacs, Jameson) and the crisis of ends-oriented thinking in eighteenth century ethics and politics (Horkheimer, Charles Taylor, Alasdair MacIntyre, Thomas Pfau). Our aim will be to arrive at an account of the function of the \"embedded utopia\" chronotope in early novels.",

The course will emphasize various literary styles and ideological constructions that, in different ways, reflect the complexity of Latin American writing.  While introducing students to the social and historical context in which the works were written, the course will focus on the following issues: the cultural and political dimensions of literature; the representation of class, gender, and race; the formative impact of nationalism and internationalism; and the concern for finding autochthonous modes of expression.

    "overview": "From antiquity until today the \"West\" (itself a troubled concept) imagined many things in Africa. Power, weakness, wealth, poverty, beauty, savagery, knowledge, ignorance, light, darkness. We are all heirs of these incoherent visions; a bequest that appears in widely held and constantly renewed beliefs and assumptions about the \"Dark Continent.\" Visions of Africa today revolve largely around a set of tropes developed in the 19th century - Africa as benighted, undeveloped, female, chaotic, famine-ridden, and incapable of self-governance. However, as with all instances when one position gazes at another, the result is both accurate and inaccurate. In this class, we will turn our gaze on contemporary Africa from a cultural anthropological perspective. Using the tools of anthropology, we will visit several arenas critical to contemporary African cultures - music \u0026 dance, cinema, literature, sport, the body, technology, politics and development, among others. Through these various lenses, we will attempt to better understand cultural choices and what we can say about Africa/ns from our perspective. That is, to recognize and value both internal and external views of the continent. Through these arenas and these perspectives, we will better know issues of power, gender, hierarchy, spirituality, and economics. Will you arrive at an entirely accurate view of Africa and Africans? Never. The journey, however, will take you closer.",

The poems to be studied will be examples of traditional accentual-syllabic verse, written from c. 1580 to c. 1960, and some introductory instruction on poetic meter will be included. We will read newer and/or easier poems first and then move on to older and/or more challenging poems. Some possible authors (in reverse chronological order) include Robert Hayden, Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Thomas Hardy, A. E. Housman, Emily Dickinson, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Samuel Johnson, William Shakespeare, and Sir Phillip Sidney. Each student will write three short essays, each of which will focus on a single poem we have read or a particular crux within a poem. Students will receive guidance on academic writing and will participate in workshops in which they read and comment on each other's drafts.",

    "overview": "This seminar focuses on contemporary scholarship regarding international law as it intersects with international relations. The topic of international law is a place to study the interaction of material, power and normative forces, and a place where one can employ all of the newest methods and approaches in political science. The new international law scholarship is being built in an unusually interdisciplinary fashion. We will be reading work that builds on economic theories, sociological theories, and traditional international relations approaches. We will also be examining questions of broad interest within political science and sociology-- the social construction and influence of norms in international affairs, the importance of murky issues like legitimacy and fairness in shaping public perceptions and actor behavior, and how institutions of international law including international treaties and international courts implicitly and explicitly shape the international political process and state behavior.",

    "overview": "Though we often think of fan fiction as an advent of our contemporary moment, fan fiction extends at least as far back as the eighteenth century. Fans and fictions have increasingly shaped the way we encounter literature, animating works from the past with different agendas, desires, and needs that speak to the contemporary moment. This course explores texts and the adaptations they inspire. We will think about how adaptations not only comment on and critique earlier texts, but also how they might inspire us to encounter the original text in new ways. How might we regard adaptations as standalone works, with lives and afterlives of their own? From modern reworkings of Shakespeare to critical retellings of Austen, adaptations ask us to consider how familiar stories might be leveraged to address different audiences. We will also explore some related concerns around fan fiction including fandoms and fan culture, the death of the author, and approaching work created by problematic authors.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

All-powerful, authoritarian kingdoms and state and/or corporate powers abound in the many genres of speculative fiction—from sci-fi to fantasy, from dystopian to horror. But how do they relate to our contemporary moment and history? This class examines how empires are conceived and constructed and what roles race and gender play in their creation. Linking the history of U.S. empire building across the hemisphere with contemporary popular media and the works of Latinx and Indigenous authors and filmmakers, we'll ask: how are empires built? What purposes do they serve? How do they construct (and deconstruct) the meanings of race and gender? And finally, how does speculative fiction envision alternative futures? Texts and media may include selections from Helena María Viramontes' The Moths, Vanessa Angélica Villareal's Magical/ Realism, Cherie Dimaline's The Marrow Thieves, Andor, Game of Thrones, and The Last of Us.",

This overview will be followed by a combination of lectures and labs addressing a broad range of analytical techniques and imaging methods. These lessons will then be applied to inquiry-based learning in Northwestern's advanced centers and instrumentation cores.\n\nIn addition to lecture, students are expected to devise two Mini-Research Projects and will work on one with senior research staff to apply specific protocols utilizing instrumentation available within Research Cores and University Centers. Students will design specific experiments in selected areas of their research interest, and learn new sample preparation methods and instrumentation within one of the following areas: genomics, proteomics, in vivo and molecular imaging, small molecule synthesis and characterization; high-throughput screening, crystallography or Cryo-EM, analysis of bioelements.\n\nMaterial generated in the class counts for course credit will be usable in the students' research group settings.",

In this context, to think with the interrelations of race, gender, sexuality, class, poverty, health, citizenship, immigration status, abilities, and nationalist exceptionalism, is also to consider the intersections of heterogeneous techniques of power. We'll consider engagements with and challenges to the Foucauldian lexicon of power (including the terms: sovereign, discipline, pastoral, governmental, biopolitical, security, neoliberal governmentality) that have been contributed by post-Foucauldian analyses whose lexicon also includes: domination, exploitation, occupation, expropriation, coloniality, and decoloniality, and which has asked how contemporary forms of resistance to power have centered around such as problems as: the formation of a sovereign right to maim; of freedom as burdened individuality; of neoliberalism as am omnipresent form of governmentality; the making of endebted life, and the deadly aspects of biopower.",

However, employers also say that students overestimate their ability to communicate effectively in a workplace context. English 282 is designed to address that gap. The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

Indeed, the ability to apply critical thinking, creativity, and empathy is what sets humans apart from machines (AI and the future of work, Statista, July 2024). This course is designed to help you learn to use Gen AI critically, responsibly and productively in written communication at NU and later in the career field you plan to enter, whether that be business, healthcare, law, science, engineering, journalism, education, or something else. We will explore ways to use Gen AI in various stages of the writing process--brainstorming ideas, organizing information, and revising drafts--while still remaining firmly in control of that process. We will also examine the ethical issues related to the use of Gen AI, as well as its limitations in terms of accuracy and credibility. As a final project, each student will present the results of their research into the current and prospective uses of Gen AI for communication in their field of interest. This course fulfills the Weinberg Advanced Expression requirement as well as some writing requirements in other Northwestern schools.",

The course offers students an invaluable opportunity to closely read, analyse, discuss and build a vital background in the essential themes of Arabic literary traditions spanning well over a millennium in chronological order and within its historical context. Students will read parts of the Holy Qur'an; Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad; letters by the SaHaba; a chapter of Arabic grammar from Sibawayhi's Al-Kitab, as well as a famous classical poem by Abu Al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, among others. The selected readings will cohesively deepen students' literary experience with ancient and medieval texts. The provided glossaries of idioms and phrases will assist students with basic comprehension, but students should also make use of a dictionary or consult the instructor.",

    "overview": "Whether fathoms beneath the ocean's surface or in the shadowy spots under our beds, supernatural beasts lurk just outside the range of our perceptions—until they emerge from concealment in order to wreak havoc! What drives our morbid fascination with these creatures? Drawing on insights from literary scholars who have explored the role of monsters in our cultural imaginary, this course aims to explore how monstrous depictions reflect the fears, desires, prohibitions, and prescriptions of the societies that create them. From the elusive \"Grendel\" in Beowulf to the colossal creatures of kaiju films like Godzilla, we will examine a diverse range of texts and films that have sent shivers down the spines of audiences across cultures for generations. As we explore these haunting and mysterious works, we will delve into questions such as: How have historical fears and anxieties been represented? Whom do we classify as \"monstrous\" and why? How do these representations either mirror or challenge prevailing cultural norms? And since real monsters don't exist, what are we actually afraid of?",

How can bad or frightening characters by appealing? What is the function of pain or illness in the moral, social, and political perspectives that literary texts propose? How does gender shape the portrayal of evil in fiction? This course will focus on close reading and the development of critical writing skills. All lectures and readings will be in French.",

    "overview": "This course provides students with an in-depth understanding of major developments in architectural, urban, and landscape history, from 1750 to 1890. Charting a period of significant change that animated architectural discourse and practice, students will explore the highly innovative and experimental ways in which key architects and planners responded to the challenges of a rapidly changing and globalizing world and to the possibilities introduced by new technologies and materials. While this course focuses on developments that took place within the European and North American frame, they are situated in relation to global processes including trade, imperialism, nationalism, migration, and industrialization. Each lecture is organized around defining transformations in architectural culture during this period: We will explore how the era of revolutions in the late 18th and early 19th centuries expanded the role of architecture in the creation of new types of public and political space; how industrial production and prefabrication gave rise to radically new architectural vocabularies and catalyzed debates about national styles and aesthetic and environmental \"character\"; and how new housing, labor, and urban reform movements, such as utopian socialism, offered visionary spatial strategies in pursuit of an elusive social equality. This course prioritizes discussion and critical reflection and emphasizes the study of primary sources.",

    "overview": "Is beauty a site of political struggle? Applying the critical frameworks developed by feminist, queer, and trans* writers and theorists, this course asks why has there been such heated disputes over beauty culture is oppressive or liberatory?  Is beauty the source of delusion and false values or the source of self-expression and empowerment?  Could it be a site of critical destabilizing practices?  To better understand the deeper stakes in this debate, the class sets these questions historically, tracing them from 17th and 18th century moral philosophy and aesthetics to 19th century physiognomics, anthropology, medicine, phrenology, and comparative anatomy.  A crucial component of this project is to uncover how elites as spectators, philosophers, connoisseurs, and scientists have constituted racial and sexual hierarchies through their aesthetic judgments of others.  \n\nThrough case studies on beauty pageants, cosmetic surgeries, bar and club cultures, as well as sports and modern/postmodern concert dance, we will study the counter-discourses and self-fashioning strategies of groups and individuals.  Focusing on the performative and bodies in motion, we will ask whether corporeal meaning can be remade from within and by \"marked\" bodies.  Instead of developing simple resistance models of opposition, we will focus on how communities establish their aesthetics to communicate their goals, hopes, and pain.",

Rising sea levels and increasing ocean acidity, higher temperatures, more droughts, melting glaciers, wilder weather patterns, and mounting environmental disasters mean that climate change is increasingly visible in our daily lives. What role does human society play in these changes, and what consequences does society suffer as these changes occur? This course is an introduction to environmental sociology during which we will employ an intersectional, sociological perspective to look beyond the scientific basis for environmental problems to understand the social roots of environmental issues. We will cover a variety of topics in environmental sociology, including how actors such as corporations, the media, and social movements impact public opinion and environmental issues. Further, we will critically examine the gendered, racial, and socioeconomic production of disparate environmental risks. A primary, central focus of this sociology course is environmental inequality, and students engage with a wide range of theories to examine environmental issues of their own choosing. This is not a public policy course.",

    "overview": "Political corruption, murderous conspiracies, adulterous affairs, and deceptions of all kinds  plague the realms of detective fiction.  If only a knight in shining armor would arrive on the scene to untangle the web of lies, or rescue the damsel in distress, or solve the puzzle of \"whodunit?\"  And that's exactly how fictional detectives are often characterized.  Indeed, the very first fictional detective, Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin, had the title Le Chevalier, the French word for a knight.  This figure of the knight invites us to consider the detective's investigation as a lonely, but noble and heroic, quest for the truth.  It also invites us to assume that the quest is undertaken by a gentleman for the sake of a lady's honor, and that the grail-like truth is something that only he will be able to discover.  What happens, however, when the truth-seeker is no longer a man of honor, or a man at all?  Or, when the lady in question is no longer in distress, but the cause of the distress?  Or, when the social order on whose behalf the detective-knight supposedly works is no longer committed to seeking the truth, but to covering it up?  That's when things get interesting.  We'll begin our class with Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" which raises pointed questions of human culpability and bestial violence, and end with Colson Whitehead's The Intuitionist, which transforms the detective's traditional powers of \"deduction\" based on empirical evidence into something like its opposite, pure \"intuition.\"  Along the way, we will examine who gets to occupy the position of the detective, and how the identity of the detective affects both the quest for truth and its relationship to power.  And, I don't think we'll be able to avoid the meta-question of how reading a novel or viewing a film is like the work of detection.",

The goal is to understand their significance in East Asian cultures, as well as consider what we can learn from these texts today. This course will probe the following questions: What are the major themes, dilemmas, and issues these texts address? How can humans achieve contentment in the world? What are the moral values these texts instill? Beyond a historical focus, this course will also reflect on ways that these literary and religious texts have been appropriated and adapted in the modern context. Each period dedicated to a specific text will be preceded by an introduction to the tradition it represents offering historical background together with biographical and/or content outlines.",

    "overview": "AY25.  Over the last decade, posters announcing \"Refugees Welcome Here\" have appeared across the American landscape. The post-9/11 era has seen the displacement of 38 million people over the Middle East and North Africa due to the ever-escalating effects of US militarism, not to mention the thousands of civilians who have died in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Palestine, and surrounding regions. Against the backdrop of what Afghan anthropologist Anila Daulatzai calls \"serial war,\" what does the figure of the refugee tell us about the status of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries? In other words, what are human rights and why do we care about them? Who gets to be a human and who doesn't? Beginning with fiction from the mid-to-late twentieth century, this course examines the dialectical logic of dispensation and denial of human rights through literary texts across nations and genres. We will employ the lens of political theory around race, citizenship, territory, and the category of the human across global sites like Kashmir, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Palestine, Mexico as well as detention sites like Guantánamo, and Manus Island. The course problematizes an investment in the rhetoric sympathy and sentiment to unlearn what Didder Fassin calls \"humanitarian imperialism,\" instead asking what it means for human rights subjects to make demands, rather than petitions, for  protection from torture, genocide, and extralegal violence. We will read fictional as well as nonfictional accounts by global authors to consider key figures such as the refugee, the undocumented migrant, the detainee, and the animal as instantiations of what Giorgio Agamben calls \"homo sacer,\" i.e. the human who remains outside of a polity as a sacrificial surrogate against the safe haven of the settler/citizen within. Students will be introduced to scholars working in the intersections of political theory, human rights, and literary studies such as Judith Butler, Joseph Slaughter, Achille Mbembe, Sonali Thakkar, and others.",

    "overview": "This course invites students into an interdisciplinary, intersectional exploration of how Black sex and sexualities are imagined, governed, and experienced in the U.S. and beyond. Through an array of critical lenses, we will investigate the ways colonial, slavocratic, antiblack, capitalist, patriarchal, and heterosexist systems have shaped dominant discourses and practices surrounding Black sexuality. In undertaking this work, we will center Black voices, bodies, and desires, exploring how Black people have navigated, resisted, and redefined these constraints to articulate their own erotic lives.\n\nDrawing from a rich array of sources—including music, film, visual art, and performance art, as well as texts in Black feminist theory, queer of color critique, histories of sexualities, critical ethnography, and porn studies—students will engage with Black sexuality as a charged site where power, pleasure, vulnerability, and freedom intersect. By the end of the course, students will have developed tools to critically analyze representations of Black sexuality, while also considering the radical potential of Black eroticism as a space of self-expression, joy, and resistance.",

Drawing primarily on examples from recent history, including conflicts in the Balkans, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, we will explore warfare as a crucial sociopolitical determinant of global health disparities and consider organized efforts to respond to the health impacts of mass violence. Key topics that we will consider include variations in the relationship between warfare and public health across eras and cultures; the health and mental health impacts of forced displacement, military violence, and gender-based violence; and the roles of medical humanitarianism and humanitarian psychiatry in postwar recovery processes. Through close readings of classic and contemporary social theory, ethnographic accounts, and diverse research on war, health, and postwar humanitarian interventions, this course will encourage you to build your own critical perspective on war and public health anchored in history and the complexities of real-world situations.",

    "overview": "This seminar is an inquiry into how we experience religion in the world today. It takes seriously the idea of religion as mediated phenomena. We experience the religious through an engagement with multiple sensorial forms—things seen, felt, tasted, heard, and smelt. These can include a wide set of media ranging from YouTube videos of preachers to calendars with images of Hindu deities sold in bazars; mechanized prayer counters to the corporeal remains of venerated figures; food distributed in Hindu temples, Muslim shrines, Christian churches and Sikh gurdwaras to water brought back from pilgrimage to holy sites; Gregorian chants to Muslim calls to prayer; incense lit to commemorate the dead to camphor burnt before the image of the divine. The spaces in which we experience these religious phenomena are ever broadening as well. We do not experience the religious in places of worship alone but also at museums and in public buildings, on superhighways and in cyberspace. \n\nWhile this seminar adopts the perspective of religious materiality, with its concern for aesthetics, presence, memory, and space, it does not require previous knowledge of specific theories or familiarity with any particular religious tradition. It invites students specializing in different traditions and frameworks to engage with scholarship on religion and media in the hope that it offers a fresh perspective on their own materials.",

    "overview": "If you've ever encountered a fictional monster, or enjoyed a horror story, chances are you were reading a gothic text. Originally considered to be a form of trash writing, the genre now manifests itself in various cultural forms: novels, short stories, movies, poems, theatre, and graphic novels. Gothic texts thrive on depicting the unspeakable horrors and pleasures that make up our psychological lives. Unsurprisingly, then, they have been hugely popular across history. They make great examples of how popular writing has served as a medium for authors to think through complex and broad-ranging issues, engaging questions of identity, race, gender, and sexuality. \nWriting Trash looks at gothic literature to think through the following questions: how do we write, and how do we write better? In this course, we will examine a few exemplary instances of gothic writing — such as Jekyll and Hyde, and Destroyer — to illuminate and demystify the process of expository writing. Our insights about gothic literature will serve as material for understanding and asking questions about how we practice the art of writing. What constitutes ‘good' and ‘bad' writing, and who decides? What is style? What is the relation between fictional or creative writing and expository or critical writing? Our chosen gothic texts will allow us to see how writing to tell a story involves careful use of the raw materials of language: vocabulary, syntax, style. In turn, Writing Trash will inculcate a practice of thinking about the writing process that you can take away and apply further in telling stories that are important to you.",

Recently Python has become practical for coding in embedded systems, as well. Embedded microcontrollers are relevant for our annual robot design competition, NU engineering teams (Solar car, Baja), internships, and experimental apparatuses.  Our approach to coding emphasizes algorithm creation, debugging, methodical creation and partitioning in a modern notebook framework, as well as hardware-level access for microcontroller applications.

Some of the course will be in lecture format, and a significant portion of the course will be reading current papers in the area.

Topics will include early moralistic and educational stories, stories about developing self-confidence and strength to be able to exist in the adult world, stories about life on Earth and whether it is threatened, stories that deal sensitively with the topics of homosexuality and rainbow families, phantasy stories, and stories about children with different cultural backgrounds and their difficulties to fit in. These German children stories offer us a rich array of genres and themes to write about using sophisticated ways of expressing ourselves in German.\n\nStudents will have a chance to write a unique children's story using generative artificial intelligence tools as a thinking partners. Interacting with ChatGPT in German, students will engage in informal and low-stakes writing-to-learn activities to help them think through ideas and key concepts for their stories, as well as to learn new vocabulary, expressions, and language patterns.  Previous research has shown that generative artificial intelligence tools can provide both explicit and implicit learning situations that focus on vocabulary development and grammar in a meaning-focused context.",

We will focus on how to properly analyze context-sensitive expressions (e.g. pronouns, descriptions, demonstratives), how a discourse is structured, the varieties of content that a sentence can convey (e.g. at-issue content, presuppositions, expressive content, conventional implicatures), and end the quarter by reading recent work on a topic to be decided upon by the students (e.g. slurs, dogwhistles, metaphor, tense). Our approach will be both interdisciplinary at times by reading important work in linguistics, and historical at times by reading influential philosophical work from early in the 20th century.",

In the second section of class, you will learn how brain circuits contribute to sensation (vision, touch, taste, smell, hearing, and balance). In the third section of class, you will learn about how brain circuits contribute to movement. In the final section of the class, you will learn how brain circuits contribute to diverse cognitive processes including emotion, memory, and speech. As new topics are introduced, you will learn about the research foundation of existing knowledge, and the many exciting unanswered questions that remain.",

    "overview": "Reading Gender Otherwise: Theories of Gender and Indigeneity in \"Latin America.\" \n\nThis course draws from a rich archive of theoretical frameworks to interrogate gender as a paradigm that mobilizes myriad forms of sociopolitical oppression. Readings during the first unit of the course will explore Latin American approaches to coloniality and the decolonial turn, with special emphasis on gender as theorized by Sylvia Wynter and PJ DiPietro, among others. In the second unit of this course, we turn to Buen Vivir philosophy. Loosely translatable as \"Good Living,\" Buen Vivir a key expression of Indigenous autonomy and plurinational movements throughout Abiayala (Guna Language meaning \"the Americas\" [lit. \"continent of plenitude and maturity\"]).Through the use of Indigenous methodologies, we consider: how might we interrogate gender without reproducing colonial logics? In other words, how do we read for gender while aspiring to what Catherine Walsh has called \"thinking-otherwise,\" with a keen eye toward what Indigenous autonomous group U jeets'el le ki'ki' kuxtal has called the \"colonization that has slipped in and deeply embedded itself in our territory, our minds, and our hearts?\" We close this course by exploring the role of the text in imagining Indigenous autonomy. Spanish reading knowledge is strongly recommended for this course. Please contact instructor with questions regarding language recommendation.",

    "overview": "\"Latinx Futurism\" \n\nWhat is Latinx futurism? Most of the imagined futures we are exposed to in the United States have been crafted by white authors. From Isaac Asimov's science fiction novels about robots to high-production value blockbusters. An alternative cannon, Afrofuturism, has begun to blaze a path for understanding why the political, racial, and cultural position of those doing the imagining matters. In do so, Afrofuturism aims to inspire us to think carefully about how we deal with the pressing social issues of our time and have offered a new lens for thinking about the future. This discussion-based seminar takes this as a departure point and works towards including Latinx futurism in this frame. This seminar is an introduction to a way of thinking sociologically about technology, science, and society from the perspective of Latinx and Latin American communities. In their reading and writing assignments students will explore a broad array of topics, from the origins of postcolonial states, Zapotec science, and borderlands epistemology.",

    "overview": "\"Black Classicism\" is the study of black scholars, writers, and artists who deliberately engage with and extend the classical tradition (read: neoclassical works) as well as the creative and intellectual production by those scholars and writers. Michelle Valerie Ronnick coined the term Classica Africana in 1996 to describe, in short, \"the influence of classical studies on people of African descent.\" Classica Africana includes those in the nineteenth century who studied and read classical literatures and languages, Greek and Latin, the students of standard formal American education as influenced by the British liberal arts system, neoclassical or black classicist writing, and, to a lesser degree, the traces of classical literatures common to popular memory. \n\nThis course introduces the long history of Black Classicist literatures in the United States. Since Phillis Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773), the very first publication by an African American in the United States, black writers have engaged with classical works by Greek and Roman authors. During this class, we will read selections from Black Classicist writers and the referent texts (in translation). We will explore the variety of fiction and poetry that may include Phillis Wheatley, Ovid, Pauline E. Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Euripides, as well as more recent work by Toni Morrison, Donika Kelly, and Kwame Dawes \u0026 Matthew Shenoda. As a class, we will create our own set of unique inquiries and explore the answers to, at least, the following questions: How do \"the classics\" inform the stories by African American authors? What kinds of capital do classical themes, plotlines, and symbolism create for Black Classicist writers? What assumptions can we make about Black authors who rewrite classical works? In what ways are those assumptions affirmed and exploded through our semester-long literary inquiry? In what ways does Black classicism alter the way we understand the classical texts to which it refers? \n\nEXPECTATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW: Assignments include a group discussion assignment, a mid-term paper, and a final group project and presentation. Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments as well as class attendance and participation. As a primarily discussion-based class, class preparation and participation are essential for success. This course depends on discussion and participation of every member of the class.",

    "overview": "This course serves as an introduction to the foundational concepts of post-colonialism and decolonization. Through an interdisciplinary approach, students will explore and critically analyze these terms by engaging with the seminal works of Edward Said, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Homi Bhabha. Particular focus will be placed on the intersections of post-colonialism and decolonization with issues of race, gender, class, feminism, and sexuality.\n\nKey topics will include hegemony, sovereignty, freedom, and the oppression of Indigenous peoples, examined through case studies from African, Caribbean, Asian, and North American contexts. The lingering impacts of colonial rule continue to shape the contemporary world, influencing international cooperation, art practices, and the engagement with cultural, historical, and political institutions.\nStudents will delve into these complexities through close readings, creative workshops, presentations, guest lectures, and viewings of art and film. The course emphasizes both theoretical and practical applications, enabling students to craft compelling arguments and reflect on how these terms relate to their personal lives and creative practices.\nBy the end of the course, students will have developed a nuanced understanding of post-colonialism and decolonization and gained the skills to critically engage with these critical frameworks in both academic and real-world contexts.",

But what is less clear is precisely how and to what extent culture shapes our psychology. The broad aims of our class are to 1) read empirical research to help us uncover which human thoughts and behaviors are cross-culturally consistent or different, 2) understand the mechanisms and functions of culture in relation to our thoughts and behaviors, and 3) apply cultural psychology insights to uncover biased practices within the modern field of psychology and expose their historical precedents. Through course readings, discussions, and assignments, we will develop and apply an understanding of how our cultures inform ourselves and our everyday behaviors. Our focus will extend beyond simply \"east\" versus \"west\" dichotomies and decentralize Western perspectives as the norm.",

At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to handle successfully a few uncomplicated communicative tasks, participate in simple conversations on topics related to personal information, personal preferences, daily activities, and immediate needs. This course is the third in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants.",

We will consider such questions as the variety of literary genres in the Bible—primeval myth, epic, lyric poetry, prophecy, proto-novel; the representation of God as a literary character; and dominant images and themes.  We will focus on those books that have had greatest literary interest or influence. From the Torah we will read Genesis, Exodus, and parts of Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy; from the Prophets, Amos, Hosea, Jonah, selections from Jeremiah and Second Isaiah; and from the Writings, the books of Judges, Ruth, Psalms and the Song of Solomon, along with the stories of Kings Saul and David and portions of the Wisdom literature. In the New Testament, we will read selections from the Gospels according to Matthew, Luke, and John and the book of Revelation. (We're skipping Paul because he's more a theologian than a literary writer.)",

Focused largely on the United States and the Caribbean, the photographic and videographic practices of Dawoud Bey, Arthur Jafa, Rodell Warner, Carrie Mae Weems, and Cosmo Whyte, among others, will be considered. We investigate this work through site visits to exhibitions around Chicago, including at the Arts Club and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

For over 20  years, the Citizen Lab -- an interdisciplinary research laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto (which the instructor founded and currently directs) -- has investigated issues at the intersection of information and communication technologies, human rights, and global security. We use a \"mixed methods\" approach to research combining practices from political science, law, computer science, engineering, and area studies. We see ourselves as a kind of \"early warning system,\" looking over the horizon, or peering beneath the covers of the technological systems that surround us, to expose abuses of power, violations of human rights, or other threats to privacy and security. The Citizen Lab is a pioneer in a new and growing field of \"digital accountability\" research.\n\nAfter setting the stage with some general readings on background and context, we turn to several modules organized as detailed examinations of the Citizen Lab's mixed methods research on information controls, including analyzing Internet and social media censorship and surveillance, investigating targeted digital espionage, and analyzing the harms and consequences of growing digital transnational repression. We conclude with an exploration of threat modeling and how each of you can improve your own digital hygiene.",

How do we lose--or find--our place in a colossal fictional world?\n\nOne can find only a few examples in world literature of bigger, more capacious, more ambitious books than Moby-Dick.  In the first place, of course, the book is long, and part of our work will be to consider the specific pleasures and challenges of reading a big book.  But Moby-Dick is also big in another sense: it has proven to be a hugely influential and profoundly consequential novel.  Indeed, one cannot really understand U.S. literary, cultural, and political history if one has not come to terms with its story and the issues it engages.  Our work will be, like Captain Ahab, to take on Melville's Leviathan better to understand the worlds the novel has helped to shape—including, by no means incidentally, our own.",

Rather than prioritize processes of cultural exchange, this seminar takes the various revolutions (political, social, economic) that defined this period of global history as a transcultural framework for examining the co-evolution of French and Ottoman art. This seminar combines deep analysis of individual artworks with historical and theoretical readings from disciplines outside of art history, including postcolonial studies, feminist theory, queer theory, comparative literature, and MENA studies. In addition to studying established frameworks for analyzing Franco-Ottoman art history (such as Orientalism), this seminar also explores new approaches for writing transcultural art histories at the intersection of revolution and empire. This seminar will be of interest to students of art and imperialism, modern French and Ottoman cultural history, Orientalism, and revolutionary politics and aesthetics. Students are welcome to write their final research paper on any topic that touches on these themes.",

    "overview": "Indo-Persian poetry was present at the very birth of the concept of \"world literature\": indeed, the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (d. 1832) coined the term Weltliteratur in part thanks to his admiration for the Persian poet Hafez Shirazi (d. 1390). Of course today the Persian language — or \"Farsi,\" as it is also known — is most commonly associated with the nation-state of Iran. But the historical association with world literature reveals a forgotten cosmopolitanism. Before the nineteenth century, Persian served for nearly a millennium as the literary and political lingua franca across virtually the entire eastern Islamic world, including vast stretches of South, Central, and West Asia.  This course will introduce students to some of the most common genres of Indo-Persian literature, such as the romantic epic (masnavi), the courtly panegyric (qasida), the quatrain (ruba‘i) and especially the lyric (ghazal), as well as to some of the canonical poets of the era and the historical context in which they lived and wrote.  Expressions of love, longing, mysticism, and dissent against religious orthodoxy were among the most common themes of this literature, giving rise to its many modern afterlives — for example, in Urdu and Turkish literature, but also in European Romantic poetry, American Transcendentalist philosophy, and the music of Bollywood cinema, to name just a few.  \n\nAll readings will be in English or in English translation, so no prior knowledge of Persian is required for this course; but students who do have some familiarity with Persian, or with related languages like Urdu, Turkish, or Arabic, are of course most welcome to read texts in the original languages if they so desire. Class time will be a mix of lectures that situate our literary readings in their global historical context, with time also set aside for discussing the literature itself, issues of translation, and scholarly debates about \"world literature\" itself as an analytical category.",

The emphasis of Stat 420-3 will be on those theoretical topics that are used in the development of statistical methods. Application of theoretical ideas to models used in practice, such as the normal-theory linear model and its various extensions, will be considered in detail. The course is intended to be useful to students in areas such as engineering and economics as well as students in statistics.",

    "overview": "​​This course offers a study of Berlin, Germany's world-famous role as a major center of contemporary dance music (techno, house, disco) and nightclub culture. Beginning in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Berlin, the city quickly became home to cutting-edge DJs, party planners, club owners, and dancers, including notorious clubs like Tresor and Berghain. Coming together, they pioneered new ways to express oneself and connect with one another through music and dance. \nTogether, we will explore many aspects of this culture, from the unique genres of music and how DJs create music to the technology of sound, the experience of dancing and of clubs as spaces, and the politics of belonging, representation, and identity on the dance floor, in particular its complicated exchanges with Black communities and music in New York, Chicago, and Detroit, the birthplaces of this music. We also will consider the social, cultural, and political implications of nightlife and dance music as a site of community-building, friendship, and love within contemporary Western society, especially for queer communities. Finally, particular emphasis will be placed on understanding, analyzing, and discussing how music is made, how it works, and how it feels.\n\nThere will also be an experiential component to the course where you will talk with professional DJs about the course topics.",

    "overview": "Course title: Dilemmas of American Power\n\nIt isn't easy being a superpower. For the past 75 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Cold War traces an arc that reaches from nuclear arsenals to fleets of unmanned drones, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to a raft of conflicts in the Middle East and Europe. And, now, amid war and uncertainty, the United States has a new president who rode into office on a promise of \"America First.\" In his first weeks, he upended 60 years of support for foreign aid, announced his goal of controlling the Gaza Strip and imposed tariffs on close allies. The course draws upon an engaging set of case studies and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means. As the course progresses, we will pay particular attention to the foreign policy choices of President Trump and the domestic debate about those choices.\n\nLecture and discussion. Two in-class exams and a final essay on a related topic of your choice. This is not a class where you are expected to produce journalism, and no prior experience with journalism or Medill is required.\n\nThis course is cross-listed with Jour 353.",

    "overview": "Health is simultaneously one of our most basic needs and one of our most commodified goods. We race for cures, rally for affordable and accessible healthcare, debate the ethics of various treatments, and pass laws meant to keep our public healthy. But what do we mean when we talk about \"health\" or what constitutes a \"disease\"? How do we define disability, and for what purpose? Who is served by \"health politics\"? This course examines chronic illnesses and disability (CID) among adults, focusing on the medical and psychosocial aspects of various mental and physical health conditions with implications for political domains of functioning.\n \nThe primary aim of this course is to offer students an opportunity to explore the continuum of chronic illness and disability (CID) within adulthood through a political science lens. CID will be addressed by studying theoretical underpinnings drawing from medical, psychosocial, and political schemas and examining how these dimensions of understanding interact at the level of the individual, the family, the community, and the society-at-large.",

    "overview": "Class title: Are You What You Speak? Language and Politics in Central and Eastern Europe\n\nIs Kashubian (Cassubian; kaszëbsczi jãzëk; or in Polish język kaszubski) a dialect of Polish or a separate West Slavic language closely related to Polish? In Ukraine are Russian-speaking Ukrainians Ukrainians? Are German-speaking Turks in Germany Germans? Are Sorbian-speaking Germans in Germany Germans? Are Czech and Slovak the same or different languages? In Estonia if you only speak Russian can you be Estonian? This course explores the deep connections among language, identity, and power in a region shaped by shifting borders, political upheavals, linguistic diversity, and cultural and dialectal continua. We'll examine how language is used as a tool of identity and nation marking and building, resistance, and exclusion to the point of often denying identity. Topics to be examined include: language myths, language vs. dialect, language policies, language planning, language and identity, language rights.\n \nAs the final paper for this course, students will work on any geopolitical area in the world and examine the sociolinguistic issues particular to that region or linguistic variety.   \n \nSome previous papers, for example, have looked at:\n \n·         the role of Japanese in Korea;\n·         Koreans in Japan and language discrimination issues;\n·         the languages of South Africa;\n·         the status of African-American English (or African-American Vernacular English, or Black English) in the US and the controversy surrounding it in the 1990s in the Oakland, CA school district;\n·         US language change and the Internet and social media;\n·         Celtic in Ireland;\n·         the successful revival of a dead language, e.g., Hebrew, as the official language of Israel;\n·         the successful revival of a dying language, e.g., Native American/Amerindian languages, Hawai'ian, etc.;\n·         language rights in the EU;\n·         American Indian/Amerindian languages;\n·         bilingualism in the US or Canada;\n·         ASL (American Sign Language);\n·         Kurdish language discrimination in Turkey;\n·         and other topics.",

    "overview": "The aim of this course is to understand the political meaning of Blackness in the Black Radical Tradition, by examining its emergence and circulation across the Americas between the colonial-settler-slavery societies of the 16th century and the white western democracies of the 20th centuries. This requires us to think historically about Black populations, including their identities, cultures and movements in terms that include Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the United States. In short, it means understanding Blackness in the Americas as a multiplicity of Black experiences, identities, cultures, politics and histories. It is important to recall that up until the mid-point of the 20th century the overwhelming numbers of African descended (Black) populations across Africa, the Americas and Europe lived under formalized colonial and racial regimes based on different institutionalized versions of western white supremacy. During the 20th century despite Black populations in Latin America and the United States being citizens of independent countries while those in Africa and the Caribbean largely remained colonized subjects, Black populations throughout this Black Diaspora, were routinely the subjects of racial subordination, racial segregation and racial violation. It is in relation to these conditions that the course discusses political Blackness, in particular why and how it emerged and the ways in which it persists into the 21st century, enabling critiques of white supremacy and mobilizing movements of politics, culture and identification. Throughout the 20th century the colonial question of race, its rule over Black populations lives, and diverse Black resistances to race, have deeply influenced the cultural and political orientations and solidarities of Black people across the Americas. The course is a reminder that Black populations across the Americas have historically navigated and attempted to overcome through politics and culture, the same and different continuities and discontinuities of racial subordination, segregation and violation affecting Black populations. The course will focus primarily on Latin America and the Caribbean.",

    "overview": "This is a project-based laboratory to investigate the genetic roots of neurobiology and behavior in a simple model system. We will study neural circuits and behavior using mutant analysis, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, and circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques through assigned projects. You will then design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course. This will be summarized in a lab report due during finals week.\n NOTE 1:  This course requires manual dexterity, steady hands, and good vision. You will need to handle flies while keeping them healthy, dissect their brain tissue, and troubleshoot practical problems. If any of these might pose extraordinary challenges for you, please talk to the instructor before registering.    \n NOTE 2: You will need to come into the labs outside class time at least a few times a week to collect virgin flies. This is done at the beginning (before 9:15 am) and the end of the day and it is an ongoing task. Later in the course you likely also will need to come to finish experiments. Time outside regularly scheduled class is typically 2 or more hours per week, scheduled to our mutual convenience, and motivated students often elect to spend more time. Prerequisites: NEUROSCI 202-0 and NEUROSCI 206-0; or NEUROSCI 311-0 and NEUROSCI 206-0; or BIOL SCI 302-0.",

Using interdisciplinary research with a focus on sociological studies, we will interrogate the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss health inequalities between women, men, and trans* people from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, using sociological research to understand why these inequalities and forms of difference emerge and are sustained. We will explore how modern Western medicine views male and female bodies and defines their health and illnesses accordingly. Students will complete two short research projects over the term in which they use different data sources (interviews and media content) to examine gendered perceptions of health, health behaviors, help-seeking behaviors, and experiences with medical institutions.",

Despite popular narratives of the Midwest as purely a heartland of white homogeneity and normativity, racialized communities of color have long shaped politics, culture, and society in the region. This course emphasizes the fluid nature of ideas about race, and their interplay with the construction of place in a settler colonial society. The course materials cover a wide range of topics that are crucial for understanding both Midwestern and U.S. history writ large. From the multi-ethnic world of the fur trade, to contemporary housing inequalities, this course highlights the making of a U.S. region, and confronts mythologies of the Midwest in the American imagination.",

Moving beyond the conventional narrative of rivalry, violence, and conflict, we adopt a Relational History approach to uncover a richer and more nuanced understanding of this contested period. Focusing on interactions that extended beyond political tensions, we will examine shared identities, joint experiences, and daily encounters that shaped relations between Arabs and Jews. Topics include collaborations in mixed cities, the education system, business and labor markets, political organizations, leisure venues, and more. We will also delve into communal, personal and, at times, even romantic relationships that developed amidst the growing national struggle. Using primary historical sources, this course invites students to critically analyze how Jews and Arabs navigated their everyday lives in diverse public spheres, shedding light on an often-overlooked dimension of their shared history.",

    "overview": "Course title: Dystopia in the Americas or How not to Fall into Despair\n\nDystopia is everywhere. From Marvel movies to daily news predicting natural disasters in the upcoming decades due to human extractive activities, today we are constantly exposed to dire visions of the future. However, the word \"dystopia\" has been used to describe a sharp critique of the present while maintaining the principle of utopian hope, that is, the belief that we can live better and actually prevent catastrophe. Dystopias can be political, social, environmental, racial—among others—but they all have something in common: they express our anxieties stemming from our experience of the present. This course offers a transnational overview of different types of dystopias (ecological, political, racial, technological) in the Americas and promotes critical engagement with these narratives. We will explore movies, tv series, short stories, and artworks from Latin America-Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico—and the United States to understand how dystopias can articulate our deepest fears and anxieties, but also how, in critiquing the present, they might suggest alternatives to think outside our nightmares and envision better futures.",

In quantum physics, symmetries don't act on trajectories of particles, but on the set of wavefunctions, a vector space.   Representation theory studies the actions of groups on vector spaces, and the mathematics can elegantly teach about quantum numbers, orbitals, spherical harmonics and other topics that are difficult without the mathematical background. \n\nPrerequisites: linear algebra, some group theory and differential equations",

    "overview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "overview": "This course provides an introduction to key aspects of the Buddhist religious traditions of multiple Asian countries and the United States. Through careful examination of a variety of literature produced by these traditions, we will consider the ways in which Buddhists have understood human suffering, life after death, karma, merit, the nature of the world and human's place within it, and the path to enlightenment. Our emphasis will be on attempting to understand the moral values, philosophical insights, ritual practices, and social concerns that have shaped Buddhism over centuries of dynamic change in diverse cultural contexts. We will examine not only the history of Buddhism and its three-fold division into Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, but also facets of the contemporary practice of Buddhism with a focus on the place of mindfulness in America. In addition to textbook readings, course readings privilege primary source readings in order to introduce students directly to the narrative, doctrinal, liturgical, and biographical texts that inform our knowledge of what it has meant to live a Buddhist life over time and across cultures.",

    "overview": "Course title: Translation Problems: Coloniality, Resistance, Solidarity\n \nThis course aims to give students grounding in postcolonial and decolonial translation studies by focusing on some of the problems embedded in its history and practice: translation's employment in the contexts of war, displacement, and empire; its role in national canon formation and transnational literary circulation amid the hegemonic force of Anglicization; and the importance of translation problems —mistranslation, pseudo-translation, \"bad translation,\" and untranslatability—to projects that we might organize under the sign of  \"solidarity.\" We try to account for translation's politics and ethics, that is. We will do so by focusing on important examples of translation theory as well as by using case studies drawn from the history of Arabic-English and Arabic-French translation from the 19th to the 21st century (using work from Algerian, Iraqi, Syrian, and Palestinian authors) and by class visits—funding pending—from working translators. Readings will be provided in English. No knowledge of a foreign language is required, but students with reading knowledge of Arabic or French are particularly welcome. We will work collaboratively and creatively with all of our competencies to further the course goals.",

Even as these day-to-day acts of consumption might seem unrelated to each other, they are all connected by one critical concept: Energy. This course explores the social, political, and literary valences of energy to unearth the term's numerous and vastly divergent meanings. Over the quarter, we'll read texts ranging from Victorian novels to present day science fiction, tracking different understandings of energy that blur the line between scientific and imaginative ways of thinking. In our class discussions we'll enquire how literary authors use energy as a metaphor to name a variety of social dynamics like race, gender, class, empire, nature, and god. Reading literary texts alongside a social history of science, we'll use short writing tasks and class presentations to ask: how does the science of energy make its way through literature into our imaginations about the world? We will spend time with literary artefacts and study them with the premise that energy is both a force materially vital to life on earth and a vast imaginative resource for the worlds and societies we seek to build.  Through a grading contract that rewards your labor and treats your energies as inherently valuable, we will focus on writing process, time management, and improvement over the course of the quarter.",

In this course we learn the main concepts about disaster such as preparedness, vulnerability, resilience, response, mitigation, etc. We learn that a disaster does not have the same effect on everyone (all groups of people), and factors of social inequality such as race, ethnicity, class, and gender, make people more vulnerable to impacts of disasters. Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning. The class meetings will consist of lecture, discussion, presentations, teamwork, activities, video/audio materials and projects.",

    "overview": "What is Aerospace Engineering (AE): Aerospace Engineering is concerned with the design and development of aerial and space vehicles. The skills set required of an aerospace engineer is a combination of mechanics (solids and thermofluids), materials science (advanced composites; ceramics; polymers), and control systems. This course will cover essential topics in these areas relevant to aerospace engineering. A term project will allow the students to explore (design/analyze) simple aerospace systems (drones, gliders etc).\n\nWhy Aerospace Engineering: Unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly becoming important for both military and civilian applications. In the space sector, the US has embarked on an effort to privatize space launches. The demand for engineers with aerospace skills set is therefore likely to increase in the coming years.",

Course readings will examine the intersections between food history and histories of gender, race, migration, industrialization, globalization, and the environment.\n\nStudents will write individual research papers that use primary sources to make a historical argument about a topic of their choice. We will work on these projects throughout the course, with multiple deadlines and opportunities for feedback across the quarter. Papers might explore the history of a specific dish, cuisine, restaurant, cookbook, or individual - or investigate subjects like food safety, dietary advice, advertising or activism (among many others).

    "overview": "Over the last century, Poland has undergone an extraordinary range of transformations and traumas: the end of partition among three empires (Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian) leading to the brief period of interwar independence; Nazi conquest, and the virtual elimination of Poland's Jewish population; Soviet subjugation; Solidarity and the revolt against Soviet rule; martial law; and in 1989, independence once again. Poland's shifting borders and the complex history and politics they represent provide a unique point of entry into modern European history. In this course, we will explore the distinctive ways in which history and culture combine in a colonized nation at Europe's heart by way of novels, films, essays, memoirs, journalism, and poetry. Authors to be read will include Nobel Laureates Czesław Miłosz, Wisława Szymborska, and Olga Tokarczuk.",

This course will explore coming-of-age stories and some of the challenges presented both by difficult and complicated relationships, and by the social and political forces that shape the worlds in which the protagonists are raised. What role do friendships and family play in creating identity, and how might betrayal be a part of growing up? How are the stakes different and higher for some, and how do gender, race, and class play a role in narrowing a person's choices?\n\nWe'll begin by considering the novel and tv series, My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante, looking in particular at the female friendship at its center; then we'll examine some of the ways that coming of age is represented in film, looking at Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, Sophia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, and Greta Gerwig's Ladybird; we'll think about the way that graphic memoirs can capture both the personal and the historical, considering Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis and Thi Bui's The Best We Could Do; and finally, we'll consider how films like Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Jordan Peele's Get Out might make us think differently about what it means to come of age and help us consider the question: How do we push against the life stories that have been chosen for us?",

    "overview": "The election of Barack Obama, the country's first Black president, marked a significant watershed in American race relations. His presidency prompted heady expectations for greater racial tolerance and inclusion, but also fueled grim worries about racial backlash and conflict. The contest to select a new president, following Obama's two terms, and the victory of Donald Trump amplified the concerns about deepening racial divisions in the country. How could the same nation that elected Obama immediately elect Trump and then re-elect him again after a four-year interregnum? This is the animating paradox we explore in this seminar. The course examines shifts in American racial politics during the Obama and Trump presidencies.\n\nWe will consider each president's vision of the country's troubled racial history and ongoing racial challenges, juxtaposing Obama's aspirational appeal to multiracial democracy with Trump's stoking of racial grievance. Our survey will take stock of Blacks' political fortunes, racial attitudes across groups, reactions to demographic and economic change, and racial dynamics in party politics and public policies over the course of these two consequential presidencies. By the end of the course, students should have, at a minimum, a deeper, more fine-grained understanding of racial dynamics in American politics in the wake of these two historic presidencies. The more ambitious aim of the seminar is to help you cultivate or refine your own perspective on the quest for racial equality and nature of democracy in the United States.",

    "overview": "The environment and our natural resources are scarce yet their values are quite hard to determine. Furthermore, there are a variety of problems with the incentives to use them well. Using the tools of microeconomic analysis and some econometrics, this course will define and examine \"environmental problems\" in terms of economic efficiency. We will also discuss the methods (and shortcomings of these methods) used by economists and policymakers to place dollar values on environmental amenities (since such valuations will determine what policy options are deemed \"efficient\"), such as benefit-cost analysis. Then we will apply these tools to look at a particular set of environmental problems caused by negative externalities transmitted through naturally occurring amenities, and the effects of the policies we construct in response to these problems. NOTE: This class is not open to students who have taken Economics 370: Environmental \u0026 Natural Resource Economics.",

    "overview": "This course in the history of political theory examines influential texts from ancient Greece (e.g.,Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle). In SQ 25 the course will focus on Plato's Republic, a dense, artfully crafted prose text that sustains a long, complicated argument about the nature of justice and why we should care.  Along the way the text raises issues such as the nature of freedom, vulnerabilities of democracy and the logic of power.   Note that we will concentrate on engaging with primary sources (in translation). This course does not provide an introduction to trends in contemporary scholarship.  We will however pause at times to consider moments of modern popular reception. For example, when asked by a journalist what one book (besides the Bible) he would want to have if stranded on a desert island, Martin Luther King Jr. answered, \"Plato's Republic.\"",

In the last decade, archaeology has undergone major transformations in our goals, methods, and research questions.

At the same time, archaeologists are increasingly justifying their work in terms of its relevance to pressing modern issues like climate change. In this class, we will consider different forms of community engagement (e.g., repatriation); what usefulness means to various stakeholders; and the potentials and limitations of a 'usable past' approach.",

    "overview": "Why are so many horror movies about religion? How does religion help people through experiences of horror? How does religion create and normalize horror in everyday lives? How does horror help us construct and understand the differences between \"other people\" and \"other people's religions\" and our own selves and religious worlds? \n\nThis class explores these and other questions about the relationship between religion and horror. We will consider how horror as a genre can be a meaningful way for people to think through their experiences of religious trauma, and how religion has likewise been a meaningful way to heal from the horrors of war, loss, and violence. In the first half of the course, will consider how the languages of horror, monstrosity, and the unknown have been used to construct the bodies and ideologies of \"other people\" from ancient world cultures to modern ones. We will analyze how processes of fear and hate, like racism and xenophobia, draw from (and reproduce) strange and frightening constructions of religious \"others.\" We will watch movies like the 2019 hit Midommar, read monster theory, and explore the histories of giants, zombies, and vampires. The second half of the class will turn towards the self, and explore how filmmakers, authors, and theorists have used horror to think about their own religions and religious experiences. We will consider why images of violence and bloodshed are often experienced as holy within devotional practices, how love comes to be associated with sacrifice and suffering, and how bodies are marked concurrently as cites of horror, disgust, and transcendence. We will watch the 1973 classic The Exorcist, read medieval visions of hell, explore tales of hungry ghosts, spirits, and revenants, analyze encounters with demons, jinn, and dybbuks, and ask whether frightening fictionalized worlds can help people reflect on and heal from experiences of religious abuse. \n\nAs a first-year writing seminar, students will be asked to introduce their own areas of interest into course discussions and assignments as they develop analytical writing projects that grapple with questions of religion and horror. Students will develop skills in analytical writing, creative thinking, academic question asking, and classroom collaboration.",

Are there philosophical and historical undertones to productivity vlogs on youtube? Even as these day-to-day acts of consumption might seem unrelated to each other, they are all connected by one critical concept: Energy. This course explores the social, political, and literary valences of energy to unearth the term's numerous and vastly divergent meanings. Over the quarter, we'll read texts ranging from Victorian novels to present day science fiction, tracking different understandings of energy that blur the line between scientific and imaginative ways of thinking. In our class discussions we'll enquire how literary authors use energy as a metaphor to name a variety of social dynamics like race, gender, class, empire, nature, and god. Reading literary texts alongside a social history of science, we'll use short writing tasks and class presentations to ask: how does the science of energy make its way through literature into our imaginations about the world? We will spend time with literary artefacts and study them with the premise that energy is both a force materially vital to life on earth and a vast imaginative resource for the worlds and societies we seek to build.  Through a grading contract that rewards your labor and treats your energies as inherently valuable, we will focus on writing process, time management, and improvement over the course of the quarter.",

In addition, we will take up questions that have formed the core of Black study in the 20th century including 1) How do Black people \"theorize\" in their everyday life and cultural production (Christian 1987); 2) What cultural forms emerge to respond to and undermine antiblackness  (Carpio 2008; Scott 2022); 3) What role does literature play in the relation of Black feeling and the creation of Black life worlds (Hurston 1928; Lorde 1978; Quashie 2022; Nash 2024). Throughout, we will be especially attentive to how gender and sexuality work in tandem with race to contribute to the emotional lifeworlds of Black people.",

    "overview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\nThe information for this section is for Professor Hatim Rahman's section.\nThis course provides students with the social science tools needed to solve organizational problems and influence the actions of individuals, groups and organizations. It prepares managers to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change. This is accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics, corporate culture and strategic organizational design.\nThe goal of this course is to help you understand what an organizational leader does and to help\nyou develop skills to be an effective leader. The course draws on theories and empirical work\nfrom psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior relating to organizational dynamics,\nmotivation, teams, power and culture. The course is based around the idea that a leader does not\nneed formal power or authority to lead. Rather, leadership arises from the ability to mobilize\npeople around a particular challenge and commitment to take action.\nIn addition to developing skills, as students of the world, we want to have a lens that helps us\nevaluate the contributions and consequences of leaders. Sadly, not all leaders are effective, and\ngiven the wrong motivations or circumstances, leaders can be quite destructive. Thus, as we go\nthrough our weekly readings, I will often ask you to reflect on particular leaders and assess what\nthey did well or not so well. Leaders assemble the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and\ngroups into combinations that best solve those organizational challenges. Effective leaders are\nable to solve these challenges, improve their teams, cultivate new leaders, accomplish\norganizational goals, and (hopefully) improve society in the process. In order to accomplish so\nmany things, they must be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence and\nmotivate others, manage diversity, tap into and motivate the human and social capital of\norganizational members, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organizational change. We\nwill particularly develop your understanding by confronting how leaders are dealing with issues\nat forefront of the \"future of work.\"",

    "overview": "The purpose of this course is to present an overview of the field of psychology. The topics we will cover include history and themes of psychology, research methods, the biological bases of behavior, perception, learning, memory, emotion, motivation, social influences on behavior, health and well-being, and psychological disorders and treatment. A combination of lectures, readings, media sources, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill knowledge of the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first-hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

While studying the language, students will be constantly exposed to the Italian culture. By the end of the intensive sequence, students are expected to achieve language, cultural, and intercultural competence enabling them to study in Italy and to embark on the minor or major in Italian.

In the second, we will discuss the different options in the international policymaker's \"toolkit\" when it comes to confronting mass atrocities (e.g., military intervention, humanitarian assistance, economic sanctions, human rights prosecutions,  etc.). In the third, we will discuss two relatively recent cases, Bosnia and Rwanda. In the fourth, students will give in-class presentations on contemporary cases of mass atrocities in the form of mock National Security Council briefings.",

In mining the \"problematic\" in pop culture, as well as the resistive work of marginalized artists, this course will explore the lyrical, sonic, and visual worldmaking enacted by contemporary pop musicians in order to make sense of the myriad roles that pop culture and media play in the production, reproduction, and maintenance of power and social operations. Students can expect to engage the work of artists such as Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Frank Ocean, SZA, and Charli XCX (amongst others) alongside texts from a diverse range of fields including Black studies, performance studies, and gender and sexuality studies. Evaluation methods include discussion posts, a short written midterm assignment, and a final creative playlisting project.",

The key concepts of quantum physics are motivated from seminal experiments, both of the early 20th century and in the modern era. Major topics include the wave nature of light and matter, the probabilistic interpretation of wavefunctions, one-dimensional potentials, and tunneling. Applications of quantum theory to modern topics such as statistics and atomic structure are introduced. The course will strengthen problem solving skills and tools, including complex numbers, series, and differential equations, to build intuition in modern physics, which differs significantly from the familiar expectations of classical physics.",

    "overview": "This course is an upper-level seminar that focuses on the legacies of the Korean War in three broad areas: how nations wage war, how nations remember war, and the consequences of war for migration and creating new categories of people. The course offers an upside-down examination of the Korean War that highlights the narratives of Korean people, be they North Koreans, South Koreans, adoptees, mixed race Koreans, Korean Americans, Zainichi, or North Korean refugees. It begins with an examination of the physical devastation of the war and the targeted use of methods and materials such as carpet bombing and napalm and then moves to a discussion of the ideological warfare tactics honed in the war's interrogation rooms. After a brief discussion of the two nation-states that emerged from the war, the course delves into the new categories of Koreans created by the war: Amerasians, adoptees, military brides, and Zainichi returnees to North Korea. The course concludes with an examination of the Korean War in memory, both collective and individual. The course draws on oral history interviews conducted by the instructor with military brides in the United States, Zainichi Koreans in Japan, and North Korean refugees in China and the Chicago area and will include several assignments asking students to listen to and interpret interview excerpts.",

We will explore the ways Black and Indigenous Studies mourn  past and present injustices while also imagining possibilities for the future. In a world of tumultuous uproar and devastation, how do these writers dream of other possibilities? Our readings will be grounded in site-specific histories, like the Anishinaabe land Northwestern currently occupies. We will often work in post-apocalyptic and fantastical contexts, such as the cyborg-futures of Janelle Monáe. We will attend to a variety of mediums—from video games to music albums and more—to consider how dreaming and imagination play out across varied genres. Assignments will emphasize expository writing skills as a means of imagining, articulating, and expressing possibilities for more just worlds.",

    "overview": "How does family nurture and threaten queerness—and how do queers nurture and threaten the figure of \"the family\"? In this course we will examine the social, cultural, and political tensions between desires for sexual freedom, on one hand, and desires for kinship, on the other. Turning to contemporary queer American literature as our guide, and drawing inspiration from discussions within feminist, queer, and critical race theory, we will investigate the similarities and differences between heteronormative, privatized forms of intimate relation and alternative, queer modes of mutual aid and just distribution. Taking a cue from writer Maggie Nelson's memoir The Argonauts, we will ask, \"When or how do new kinship systems mime older nuclear-family arrangements, and when or how do they radically recontextualize them in a way that constitutes a rethinking of kinship?\"\n\nOver the span of the course, we will read an array of poetry, fiction, and literary nonfiction that traces an arc from coming out (\"breaking the family\") to choosing queer kin (\"making the family\") and finally to abolishing the institution of the family altogether (back to \"breaking the family\"). At stake in our inquiry is an attempt 1) to better understand whether queer kinship ever really transcends the oppressive protocols of the family; and, perhaps most urgently, 2) to imagine practices of queer care and sustenance that might persist in an age threatening to retract freedoms concerning same-sex marriage and intimacy, queer adoption, and gender-expansive healthcare and reproductive technologies.",

We will discuss notions of group belonging and ideas of citizenship, nationality and ethnicity, and also compare how different ethnic groups and different national societies have handled ethnic/racial/cultural diversity.

    "overview": "What won't girls do for each other? Slumber parties—revenge plots—kissing practice—makeovers—hiding bodies—shoplifting—exorcisms! This class reclaims modern \"woman's fiction,\" a broad and dismissive publishing term, to unpack the strong, consuming, and sometimes combative relationships between best friends on the page and screen. In these texts, queer desire erodes the borders of \"just friends,\" and emotion and attachment dissolve the boundaries of personhood between besties. How do strong female attachments subvert hetero-patriarchal norms through history? How do mimicry, identification, and desire blend together? To explore these questions of identity and attachment, we will begin with twentieth-century short fiction and film, including Nella Larsen's Passing (1929), Dorothy Baker's Cassandra at the Wedding (1962), and Peter Weir's film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975). Later texts include cult classics Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997) and Jennifer's Body (2009), Sarah Ahmed's blog feministkilljoys, Brit Bennett's historical novel The Vanishing Half (2020), and selected episodes from Insecure (2016-2021) and Yellowjackets (2021). Students will approach these texts through a critical background in the history of emotion and affect theory.",

However, outside of food-based ingredients, there are also social elements that contribute to a good recipe. Food is something that outside of the social constructs of race, phobias, and isms, that can bind us all together. This interdisciplinary course focuses on defining togetherness, belongingness, and the end goal of a recipe— eating. Through the lens of recipes, meal-making, social stigmas, nutrition, and health students will explore how cultural culinary practices have become evidence for illnesses, diseases, and death for certain bodies. Course readings, videos, dialogue, and recipe analyses will provide a critical lens for students to delve into the multifaceted dimensions of culinary practices, their impact on individuals and communities, and how some practices have been sifted through and out.",

We will explore what makes Dostoevsky a great novelist and what his ideas about psychology and ethics have to say to us today.  Questions raised by these novels include:   if people are just material objects, as many believe, is morality entirely a matter of social conventions?   If one won't be caught, why not commit crimes?   What is intention?   How should one face imminent tragedy or death?  What is human goodness, and what is the effect of true goodness on other people?   Can goodness have bad effects?   These and other questions of eternal relevance are explored with special profundity in Dostoevsky's works.",

    "overview": "Course title: Indo-Persian Lit as Global Lit: Love, Longing, \u0026 Dissent\n\nIndo-Persian poetry was present at the very birth of the concept of \"world literature\": indeed, the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (d. 1832) coined the term Weltliteratur in part thanks to his admiration for the Persian poet Hafez Shirazi (d. 1390). Of course today the Persian language — or \"Farsi,\" as it is also known — is most commonly associated with the nation-state of Iran. But the historical association with world literature reveals a forgotten cosmopolitanism. Before the nineteenth century, Persian served for nearly a millennium as the literary and political lingua franca across virtually the entire eastern Islamic world, including vast stretches of South, Central, and West Asia. This course will introduce students to some of the most common genres of Indo-Persian literature, such as the romantic epic (masnavi), the courtly panegyric (qasida), the quatrain (ruba‘i) and especially the lyric (ghazal), as well as to some of the canonical poets of the era and the historical context in which they lived and wrote. Expressions of love, longing, mysticism, and dissent against religious orthodoxy were among the most common themes of this literature, giving rise to its many modern afterlives — for example, in Urdu and Turkish literature, but also in European Romantic poetry, American Transcendentalist philosophy, and the music of Bollywood cinema, to name just a few. All readings will be in English or in English translation, so no prior knowledge of Persian is required for this course; but students who do have some familiarity with Persian, or with related languages like Urdu, Turkish, or Arabic, are of course most welcome to read texts in the original languages if they so desire. Class time will be a mix of lectures that situate our literary readings in their global historical context, with time also set aside for discussing the literature itself, issues of translation, and scholarly debates about \"world literature\" itself as an analytical category.",

    "overview": "\"The risk of nuclear war is increasing, from North Korea's nuclear program to Russia's threat to use tactical nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine. The nuclear arms race is also gaining momentum, as evidenced by China's growing nuclear arsenal and the U.S. \"nuclear modernization\" program. While the use of nuclear weapons would clearly threaten humanity and the entire planet, the development, maintenance, and possession of nuclear weapons, from uranium mining to nuclear waste disposal, has profound economic and environmental consequences, especially for marginalized populations.\n\nThis advanced course in the anthropology of peace examines the role of cities - city leaders and city residents - in the politics of nuclear weapons. Cities have often been considered targets for nuclear attack, and in the 1950s, U.S. city residents routinely participated in civil defense drills. Since the 1960s, city leaders and a wide range of citizens have also been active in anti-nuclear activism. The UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which entered into force in January 2021, itself the result of global civil society efforts, has reinvigorated grassroots efforts to promote nuclear disarmament. In the U.S., more than 70 municipalities, including Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, have recently passed resolutions urging the federal government to support the TPNW. These resolutions have highlighted the connections between global nuclear security and critical local, national, and regional issues such as racism, gender inequality, economic inequality, environmental crisis, and memories of past violence. This course considers the potential implications of these city-level actions and conversations for national nuclear policy debates.  \n\nThe first half of the course will introduce the history of the development of nuclear weapons; the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; various bilateral and multilateral frameworks for nuclear non-proliferation, arms control, and disarmament; and key concepts, theories, and tools related to nuclear security. \n\nThe second half of the course will critically examine the evolution of anti-nuclear activism, particularly from the \"nuclear freeze\" movement of the 1980s to the current global campaign to abolish nuclear weapons. Throughout the course, there will be opportunities to hear from a wide range of guest speakers, from defense and security experts to atomic bomb survivors, peace activists, religious leaders, and local government officials. \n\nThere are no prerequisites for the course, and no prior knowledge of anthropology or security studies is required. Students from all majors and schools are welcome.\"",

    "overview": "This course aims to extend critiques of property through close readings and discussions of foundational and contemporary readings. We especially attend to the workings of demarcation: how lines get drawn on bodies and things in ways that make property possible. Entities ranging from land to airwaves to genes can become property once they are delimited and defined as discrete objects. We will investigate how processes of demarcation produce material objects, such as land, while simultaneously producing specific kinds of (often racialized, gendered, sexual, and classed) subjects, as lines are drawn marking and de-marking material and social boundaries, objects in landscapes, legal interests and ownability, human and more-than-human subjects, and spaces of inhabitation and violence. We further examine the varying frameworks and concepts scholars deploy to address the contemporary decolonial and environmental stakes of property, the wide array of ethnographic contexts for research, and possible ways forward considering current and longstanding challenges.",

    "overview": "The United States has always thought of itself in relation to the frontier. From early colonial contact to the Cold War space race, writers have seized on \"the frontier\" as an essentially American place. Before the existence of the United States, pilgrims imagined taming the \"wilderness\" to create a \"garden,\" a new Eden in a new world. Across the 19th century, the iconic figure of the American cowboy emerged—a rugged, masculine individualist obeying his own moral code, not the letter of the law. In the 1960s, space figured as a \"final frontier,\" prompting book, film, and television production. In a bizarre mashup of tropes, Jeff Bezos wore a cowboy hat on his flight into space on Blue Origin. Together, we will investigate representations of the \"frontier\" across its many forms in American cultural production.\n\nReadings will feature excerpts from Edgar Allan Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838) and Willa Cather's O Pioneers! (1913). Film and television include the science fiction drama of alien contact, Arrival (2016), and selections from the futuristic space Western Cowboy Bebop (1998 and 2021). As a group, we will supplement these materials based on class interest—I will provide descriptions of additional possible texts. Along the way, we will ask: What is the appeal of the \"frontier\"? How do frontiers stretch how people think of themselves? Why imagine a place beyond the rule of law? What is our relationship to artificial intelligence as an emerging frontier? Throughout our exploration of the theme of the frontier, we will write short papers, building into a draft and revision of a formal essay. In doing so, we will aim to meet the learning goals of Weinberg College for the first-year seminar: to learn how to pose interesting questions; to research and gather evidence; to organize that evidence into a convincing argument; and to develop an engaging voice and style.",

This course condenses the three-quarter intermediate Hindi-Urdu 121 course into a single quarter, and focuses on the further development of students' reading and writing skills in Hindi-Urdu, while enhancing their range of vocabulary from intermediate-low to intermediate-mid.

Course readings will examine the intersections between food history and histories of gender, race, migration, industrialization, globalization, and the environment.\n\nStudents will write individual research papers that use primary sources to make a historical argument about a topic of their choice. We will work on these projects throughout the course, with multiple deadlines and opportunities for feedback across the quarter. Papers might explore the history of a specific dish, cuisine, restaurant, cookbook, or individual - or investigate subjects like food safety, dietary advice, advertising or activism (among many others).

    "overview": "In her complementary, progressive set of essays, \"Poetry Is Not a Luxury\" and \"Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,\" Audre Lorde asserts that poetry - rather than being luxury or idle fantasy - is the \"disciplined attention to the true meaning of ‘it feels right to me'\" (37). Lorde defines poetry not as \"sterile word play\" but as \"a revelatory distillation of experience\" (37). Consequently, she situates the poetic in an inherent interrelation with the erotic, asserting that the erotic \"is not a question only of what we do; it is a question of how acutely and fully we can feel in the doing\" (54). Moving through a framework that insists on acutely and fully feeling what we do, as well as on doing and distilling what we feel in a manner that is revelatory, this course seeks to engage in Black feminist praxis - thinking alongside Lorde's conceptualizations of poetry and the erotic - to carefully examine myriad articulations of queer Black existence and embodied experience. \n \nThroughout the quarter, we will use these two essays from Sister Outsider as a springboard from which to explore the affective, intellectual, and creative significance of acute and full queer Black feelings and revelatory distillations of experience. These interventions are meant to highlight the ways that queer Black storytellers and tellers of queer Black stories - including poets, novelists, critical theorists, filmmakers, actors, painters, and performance artists - mobilize the poetic and erotic to access and articulate new modes of queer Black being, feeling, and doing.",

Ethnopharmacology instructs the student on the source materials of ancient and modern medicinal compounds, along with their processing and cultural significance.  \n \nThe goal of the class is to introduce students to the use of plants, animals, and minerals in developing medicines and the cultural theories and methodologies behind such medicines. We will examine plant metabolites, lipids, resins, and toxins; animal venoms and poisons; medicinal fungi; and minerals used in early and modern medicines. \n \nStudents will participate in class lectures and outdoor field collection of medicinal plants found on Northwestern's campus. Students will be assigned a plant from which they will create both an analog and digital plant voucher. The vouchers will be kept on campus as a yearly record of the types of medicinal plants found on campus and to track the yearly growth. Students will also learn how to make basic medicinal products (form plants that are known to be safe) such as salves, balms, and tinctures.",

    "overview": "This is the second course in the upper level econometrics sequence. We will delve deeper into the tools introduced in Econ 381-1, and we will ask when we are interested in causal effects and when estimates can be considered causal. Topics covered will include control variables, panel data, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs. We will cover how to critically evaluate econometrics and statistical methods used in policy analysis by discussing academic papers and policy briefs.",

    "overview": "The topic of exile—the forced abandonment of the place and world one calls home—captured the imagination of peoples across the ancient Mediterranean. The Greek Odyssey and Roman Aeneid, famous accounts of the predicaments of classical exile, were by no means isolated instances. These renowned poems were in conversation with narratives that circulated widely among neighboring Egyptian, Hebrew, Babylonian, Phoenician, and other ancient communities, in stories which not only produced echoes among themselves, but very likely borrowed from each other. In this seminar, we will read and discuss representative accounts of exile from the ancient Mediterranean world, highlighting their historical and geographical specificity but also reflecting on their treatment of common concerns and themes—such as homelessness and hospitality, longing and belonging, identity and otherness, hosts and guests, refugees and havens, pain and nostalgia, presence and absence, etc. While the seminar will highlight the historical and archaeological coordinates of those narratives, we will also reflect upon their relevance in discussing the very current reality of exilic life in today's world.\nAs a first-year seminar, this course is meant to hone your abilities in the practice of academic writing. The activities for the seminar address this goal by implementing peer-review processes and exploring different writing techniques and sequences.",

    "overview": "The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to the history and historiography of race and gender during the Holocaust. As with many historical events, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the context of Nazi-occupied Europe - a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted, and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped people's behaviors and responses during the Holocaust. Antisemitism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded to the Nazi onslaught in ways similar and divergent. Sexism was also an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.  While they embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racial policies. \n\nThis course serves as an introduction, but some general knowledge of Holocaust history is assumed. For the purpose of dynamic engagement, the class will be comprised of reading, writing, discussion, and a final portfolio.  The success of the course depends on the participation and enthusiasm of all.",

For most of the course, we will focus on regression-like methods for categorical outcomes, notably binary outcomes, ordered outcomes, nominal outcomes, count outcomes, and (if time permits) event outcomes. The course will also include discussion of practical issues in performing statistical analysis of secondary data. I assume that you the enter class either having data at hand to perform an analysis or that you can find data on your own. The major goals of the course are for students (1) to become proficient enough in regression models for categorical variables to understand, explain, and critique its use in articles appearing in sociology journals and (2) to be able to perform a competent analysis of data that is of sufficient quality to appear as an article in a sociology or social science journal. The major assignment for the course will be for students to write a paper that is a data analysis of secondary data. The final paper should be similar to a draft of a publishable article, although there will be some required sections not found in a regular article.",

We will examine a diverse array of texts - poetry, novels, short stories, films, videos, memoir, and critical essays - produced in both Spanish and English both in the Caribbean and in the United States by writers of Puerto Rican, Dominican and Cuban origin.  As we read, we will use exile, migration, and diaspora as lenses through which to interrogate other aspects of Latinx Caribbean cultural production.  How are these experiences portrayed, and what role have they played in the construction of identities, both personal and collective?  How have these situations shaped the development of Caribbean communities (both physical and literary) within the continental U.S.?  Should these movements be seen as patterns connected to globalization, thus serving to complicate our idea of what is Caribbean, or can they in fact be understood as fundamental to the construction of Caribbean-ness?  We will look at how exile, migration, and diaspora relate to - and help shape -- the treatment of race and gender in these works, and we will analyze the role of nostalgia and humor in the navigation of different cultural and geographic spaces.",

    "overview": "This seminar introduces students in the arts-based humanities to the study of digital aesthetics across the arts, including literature, visual art, moving images, and music. It will examine a range of aesthetic forms responsive to the popular emergence of the computer and the internet, including computer-generated prints, video games, electronic music, hypertext, print fiction, and projects inflected by vernacular digital forms such as memes. Moving historically, roughly decade by decade from the 1960s to the present, the main task of the class will be to consider the difference digital computational technologies make in the creation of aesthetic forms and the experience of them. For instance, what new forms and modes of experience become possible with computers? What exactly makes something \"digital\"? And how can we tell (or not) -- and does it matter at all -- if something was made with the aid of automated processes? And finally, how do the answers to these questions change as we move from one computational era to another, e.g. from the mainframe and hobbyist eras to the domestic reception of popular electronics and computers in the 1980s to the emergence of the World Wide Web and social media and smartphones in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s up to and possibly beyond our historical present. The seminar will also emphasize the formal analysis of a range of both experimental and popular works across media, taking care to measure the aesthetic and historical meanings of the digital in the changing imagination of computers as central to society. Finally, students will encounter and write about forms native to their chosen discipline (literature, visual art, the moving image, music) but also about newer forms that do not fit easily into discipline-specific histories. Possible texts and objects of aesthetic analysis include computer-generated prints in the collection of Northwestern's Block Museum, the Detroit Techno and Chicago House electronic music scenes, fiction by William Gibson and Patricia Lockwood, net.art by Mendi + Keith Obadike and Ricardo Dominguez, films by Ridley Scott and the Wachowskis, glitch art by JoDi, Takeshi Murata, Jon Satrom, Rosa Menkman, and others, a group session devoted to video game play, meme aesthetics, and a class devoted to experimenting with artificial intelligence. Assignments will likely include a short presentation, a short formal analysis paper, and a final paper or project on digital aesthetics on an approved topic of the student's choosing.",

She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, Harvard University. While still residing in Latin America, she studied at a M.A. program in Anthropology at the Universidad de la Cordillera (La Paz, Bolivia), and at a B.A. program in Journalism at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (Medellín, Colombia). Her teaching philosophy is to help students to develop critical reasoning skills, analytical abilities, and organizational capacities. In her courses on 19th- and 20th-century Latin America and the Caribbean, Prof. Britto resorts on all kinds of historical materials, from academic works to pop culture products. She also uses approaches and methods from different disciplines, from history to anthropology and journalism.",

    "overview": "Located in the northernmost section of South America, between two geostrategic regions, the Panama Canal and Venezuela's oil district, Colombia has been a long-standing bridge between the Caribbean, the Andean, the Pacific, and the Amazon basins, and a key ally in the consolidation of a U.S. hegemonic project in the hemisphere. However, as historian David Bushnell stated in his 1993 seminal book, Colombia is one of \"the least studied of the major Latin American countries, and probably the least understood\" in the US academia. This course puts Colombia back on the map asking instead how its histories illustrate fundamental questions about modernity and democracy in the Americas. We begin by inquiring how different actors imagined a republic after the wars of independence, then move on to examine the irruption of the masses in the public sphere to shed light on the struggles of the popular sectors to craft citizenship vis-à-vis local and national elites. We also study the legacies and consequences of these conflicts in the 20th century, and the various social and political crises as they unfolded until our present times. We conclude exploring the country's recent history: the neoliberal turn, the persistence of violence, everyday practices of resistance and accommodation, and the labors of memory. We do so by putting the historiography in conversation with the interdisciplinary literature and a collection of primary sources.",

We will take a critical approach to the idea of \"literature\" by analyzing, for example, Indigenous texts and engravings alongside historical, ethnographic, and religious documents. While introducing students to the historical contexts in which colonial era texts were written, this course will focus on how Indigenous cultures and communities articulated, transformed, and preserved their identities into the late 19th century. While the primary language of the class will be Spanish, we will also consider the linguistic diversity of Latin America through translations of works in Indigenous languages.

    "overview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\nThe instructor of this course is Richard Jolly.\nThis course provides students with the social science tools needed to solve organizational problems and influence the actions of individuals, groups and organizations. It prepares managers to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change. This is accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics, corporate culture and strategic organizational design.\nThe goal of this course is to create, develop, and enhance your leadership skills. The course is designed to prepare you to lead high-performing, successful firms in the future and to effectively steer your own careers. These will be the twin themes of the course: (1) how to establish, manage, and lead prosperous firms and (2) how to develop a thriving career for oneself.\nA key leadership task is to assemble the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and groups into those combinations that best solve the organizational problem at hand. You must manage people, information, and processes to accomplish organizational goals. You must make things happen, often under conditions or time frames that are not of your own choosing. The successful execution of these goals requires leaders to be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence, and motivate others, manage the diversity of their personal contacts, tap into and motivate the human and social capital of organizational members, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organizational change.\nThis course prepares you to achieve these objectives. You will learn fundamental tools from the behavioral and social sciences that will improve your ability to analyze organizational dynamics and take robust action.",

    "overview": "Course title: Climate Geoengineering\n\nClimate change is the keystone environmental issue of this generation, and most likely for many generations to come. While the world community and individual countries have formulated policies to address climate change, these policies are almost universally recognized as being wholly inadequate to effectuate the objective of the Paris Agreement to hold global temperatures to well below 2ºC above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit increases to 1.5ºC. Indeed, it has become increasingly obvious that achievement of Paris temperature objectives will require both aggressive emission reduction initiatives and large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal/negative emissions technologies and processes (CDR), sometimes also referred to as a major sub-category of climate geoengineering. Moreover, many believe that we will also need to deploy solar radiation management approaches, which seek to reduce the amount of incoming solar radiation, to buy us time as we decarbonize the world economy.\n\nThis course will discuss the exigency of deploying SRM and CDR approaches at scale, including potential benefits and risks of these options. It also will discuss regulatory and governance considerations at both the national and international level, as well as strategies to incentivize large-scale adoption of these approaches.",

In this seminar, we will learn about various intellectual movements that have shaped the interaction of religion and gender in Muslim societies from the nineteenth century to the present. To contextualize our understanding of these intellectual currents, we will focus on South Asia—home to one of the world's largest Muslim populations today—as a site for examining the historical evolution of Islamic perspectives on gender issues. This seminar is an opportunity to reflect on the historical intersections among Islam, modernity, and colonialism, using South Asia as a regional site and gender as an analytical category. The course is divided into two unequal parts. Part One focuses on ideological responses to historical transformations in various parts of the Muslim world. Part Two shifts to South Asia and examines how these ideas of change manifested in this region. Based on texts composed by Muslim women and Muslim male theologians, we will consider the following issues: reformist education, marriage and divorce, gender segregation, property ownership, and Muslim women's political participation. In analyzing these questions, we will elucidate the complexity of Islamic intellectual traditions and emphasize their historical dynamism, especially in colonial and post-colonial contexts. Simultaneously, we will discover the ways in which Muslim women have become agents of their own change while compromising with and negotiating multiple forms of social authority in Muslim societies.",

The course is a prerequisite for the Advanced Research Seminar in Legal Studies, 398-1,- 2, and is intended to prepare students for the design of their own research project to be conducted in 398-1, -2. Through exposure to and engagement with interdisciplinary research methods on law and legal processes, the course will provide students with a deeper understanding of law in its historical and social context. The course will provide students with a set of research tools with which to conduct research on legal institutions. The course builds on content from Legal Studies 206/Sociology 206, a prerequisite for this course. While part of the Legal Studies major sequence, the course will enrich the analytic skills of students from many fields who are interested in law or in interdisciplinary research methods.\n\nPrerequisite: LEGAL_ST 206/SOCIOL 206.\nTaught with LEGAL_ST 207; may not receive credit for both courses.\n\nThe topical focus of the course will be violence by the police and capital punishment in the United States. These topics will be explored with interdisciplinary readings and relevant legal cases. Students will be exposed to several research tools and research processes, as they also engage with material on police violence and capital punishment. In addition to shorter assignments, students will develop a research proposal on a topic of their choosing.",

This upper-level course examines the role of social markers of difference, including race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, in current debates and challenges in the theory and practice of global health. We will explore recent illness experiences, therapeutic and self-care interventions, and health practices and behaviors in socio-cultural and historical context through case studies in the U.S., Brazil, and South Africa. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, social determinants of health, biopolitics, health equity, and an ethic of care. Central questions of the course include: How do categories of \"Othering\" determine disease and health in individuals and collectives? How is medical science and care influenced by economic and political institutions, and by patient trust? How do social and economic inclusion/exclusion control access to health treatment, self-care, and care of loved ones This course focuses on the linkages between society and health inequalities in the U.S., U.S. territories, Brazil, and Africa. It offers a forum to explore how social standings (mis)inform policies. This course utilizes historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, Twitter threads of health experiences, public health literature, media reports, TedTalks, and films to bring to life the \"why's\" of health differences.",

Poland's shifting borders and the complex history and politics they represent provide a unique point of entry into modern European history. In this course, we will explore the distinctive ways in which history and culture combine in a colonized nation at Europe's heart by way of novels, films, essays, memoirs, journalism, and poetry.

Sex's violent relationship with race, which Scorsese's film so vividly depicts, has been a reality around our world for a long, long time. Here in the United States, this harmful dynamic is quite evident in the fact that marriage between individuals belonging to different races was banned by most states until 1967. In this class, we will use fiction and non-fiction to consider the relationship between sex and race in the United States, South Asia, and Europe. Focusing on the past century in our intellectual travels across the globe, we shall read novels including E. M. Forster's A Passage to India and essays like Amia Srinivasan's \"The Right to Sex.\" Thinking about themes such as family, queerness, and friendship, we will spend the quarter learning about the attraction and devastation produced by the heady collision between race and sex.",

Through readings in political science, psychology, sociology, and economics, as well as contemporary news articles, we will explore key questions such as:  Why do inequalities persist in society? How do biases—implicit or explicit—shape the way people perceive and respond to others based on race, gender, sexuality, and other social identities? What does it mean to \"discriminate,\" and how does discrimination relate to or differ from stereotypes, prejudice, and social stratification? As scholars, how have we—and how should we—measure the prevalence of discrimination and disparities, as well as their effects? And, finally, what strategies might be effective at curtailing biases, discrimination, and inequalities? \n\nBy engaging with these and related questions, this course is designed to guide students through the process of becoming better researchers and writers.",

Our approach will also pay attention to the media and materiality of Jewish transmission across different kinds of Jewish sources. All non-English language texts will be presented in translation. No prior background with Jewish sources necessary. Class time will be divided between partnered text study and group discussion, and a special site visit to Special Collections at the University Library.",

    "overview": "Through the autumn and winter of 1799 in central France, a naked boy was seen swimming and drinking in streams, climbing trees, digging for roots and bulbs, and running at great speed on all fours. He was captured in January 1800 by local farmers and brought to Paris. This \"wild boy\" from Aveyron became an overnight sensation, the object of curiosity and endless speculations about the relationship between instinct and intelligence and questions about the differences between humans and animals. A young doctor Jean-Marc- Gaspard Itard, who undertook the task of socializing and educating the wild child, carefully recorded the boy's progress. Itard's work ultimately lead to the transformation of the treatment of mental retardation and to a revolution in childhood education that is reflected in every preschool program in our time. This course introduces students to the philosophical and attitudinal changes regarding nature, childhood, and family life that enabled society to view the \"wild boy\" not as a freak or savage, but as a person inherently capable of civility, sensibility, and intelligence. The story of the \"wild boy \"teaches why it is important for humans to treat nature with respect and not fear. In order to protect the human rights of the boy, society must extend protection to the non-human beings among us. The course is designed for students interested in intellectual history, environmental history, psychology, and education.",

    "overview": "Graduate Seminar: Queer and Transgender Studies in Religion:\n\nThis seminar introduces students to the growing subfield of queer and transgender studies in religion. Combining theoretical frameworks from religious studies and queer and transgender studies, we will study the impact of religious norms on queer/trans lives within religious communities, queer/trans forms of religion that emerge on the margins of normative religious communities, and when queerness/transness become points of religious exit. We will explore the norming systems of religion and gender/sex/sexuality together, examining how they produce both normative and non-normative forms of embodiment and desire, while interrogating the boundaries of religion/race/ethnicity. Crucial to our study will be the examination of the language and categories of \"queer\" \"trans\" and \"religious\" as social identities and structural subject positions. Where do these terms originate and who do they include? Do they articulate forms of identity, practice, belief, or power? And how do we trace the boundaries of normativity in a transnational, transhistorical, and comparative ethnoreligious context?",

Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning.

    "overview": "Writing is one of the most important skills that a researcher can develop over their time in graduate school. And yet, formal training in writing is uncommon in graduate programs. This course is an attempt to fill this need for our PhD program. This course is designed to make the implicit and often hidden skills and practices that improve our writing both explicit and transparent. This seminar is designed to accomplish three goals: (1) to provide an opportunity to write; (2) to provide support and strategies to make writing part of your routine; and (3) to give you specific instruction for executing writing that you will need for the PhD and beyond. To accomplish these three goals, we will read about writing, design our schedules around writing, celebrate our writing accomplishments, learn how people structure their writing, and, of course, we will write!",

In this survey course, we problematize these questions by critically examining the production, content, and reception of Asian American representations in pop culture. What do cultural productions by/for/about Asian Americans tell us about power, resistance, and the social construction of difference? We use historical and contemporary cultural forms, including memoirs, documentaries, film, music, video games, and social media, to answer these questions.",

Yet images, icons, and other visual cues profoundly shape cultural meaning and our senses of place and self. In this class we will explore visual culture in the history of the United States, from the early Republic to the present, asking what ideas of \"America\" are being depicted and how they have changed over time. We will examine topics such as the formation of national identity, the visual language of empire, race and representation, consumerism, and the influence of mass media, while also developing a critical vocabulary with which to discuss these topics. We will situate images and objects both within their own history of making and as products of a broader cultural and social context, using them to track the complex and shifting socio-political landscape of the United States' history. At the end of the course, students will produce an original research paper which examines an aspect of visual culture in US history, and to that end assignments will be scheduled throughout the quarter to build towards the final project.",

Students are expected to have fundamental Python skills from STAT 303-1 or CS 110. The course then moves on to relational databases and how to store/obtain data from them using Structured Query Language (SQL). Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge on SQL; it will be introduced from scratch and applied during the lectures.

As a pioneering work of postcolonial theory, it has reshaped entire disciplines, from history and area studies to comparative literature, anthropology, and even the study of English literature(s). But Said has also had his critics, some very astute and others not so much. In this course, we will begin by closely reading Said's own works to try to understand them in all their nuance and complexity, and then examine some of the arguments of his later critics of various disciplinary backgrounds.",

Once per term, usually toward the end of the quarter, we will have an open-ended coding session in which you can work on any project that may benefit from the group setting, or we can use that time to collective learn something new (e.g. incorporating generative AI into our coding workflow).

    "overview": "Topic: Secrets, Silence and Lies in Postcolonial Literature\n\nConcealed murders, sexual transgressions, double agents, and eerie ghost children: postcolonial fiction is filled with dark secrets and disturbing silences. Why are secrecy and silence so pervasive in postcolonial culture, in both the political and the personal realm? This seminar will focus on three postcolonial novels set in three very distinct postcolonial cultures: the 1940's Northern Ireland of Seamus Deane's Reading in the Dark; the tumultuous Kerala province in southern India of Arundhati Roy's God of Small Things; and the wartorn 1975 Saigon and refugee-filled Los Angeles of Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer.  Focused on the unspeakable secrets and double crossings at the center of these texts, we'll explore how legacies of violence—physical, psychic, and sexual—manifest themselves when they're shrouded in silence. What are the potential consequences for a culture that misleads or refuses to speak about some of its darkest crimes and traumas? How can a code of silence and secrecy create the conditions for traitors, informants, and double agents to flourish?  We will also use several seminal writings from postcolonial studies, including excerpts from Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's Decolonising the Mind and Edward Said's Culture and Imperialism, to frame and complicate our discussions and raise new questions, such as: How does misinformation or secrecy work as a rhetorical device? How might the horror genre be used to subvert colonial narratives? In addition to the three novels, we will examine some recent versions of postcolonial narratives that have secrets, silences or lies at their center, including excerpts/episodes from Patrick Radden Keefe's Say Nothing, episodes from the Netflix series The Crown and the HBO series The Sympathizer, Thi Bui's graphic novel The Best We Could Do and Jordan Peele's film Get Out.",

    "overview": "This course has two principal missions: 1) refining and deepening students' grasp of the artistic labor of adapting literary texts into feature films, not just via script choices but in all areas of moviemaking; and 2) thinking critically and expansively about the women-centered narratives that have made their way into contemporary cinemas, with what emphases, tropes and counter-tropes, demographic ranges, and target audiences. The archive of source texts will range across fiction, memoir, journalism, plays, even social media posts. As an advanced English course, students will often be expected to read one novel and watch one film per week, with a close critical eye on each. In reflecting a range of women's experiences, some narratives will challenge us in ways they confront sexuality, violence, and power…and also inspire us with innovation, humor, and bold expression.

    "overview": "Topics in Hebrew Literature: Between Two Writers: Sayed Kashu'a and Etgar Keret \n\"This summer, the last vestiges of hope in my heart were crushed… I'm still writing to you, maybe because I want you to give me a little hope. You can lie, if you feel like. Please, Etgar, tell me a short story with a happy ending, please.\" (From a letter Sayed Kashu'a wrote to Etgar Keret on September 2014). \n \nThis course is for undergraduate and graduate students as well as post doc researchers who are interested in exploring contemporary writings by two prominent writers in Israeli culture, Sayed Kashu'a and Etgar Keret. These writers share unique perspectives on Israeli society: Keret, a son of Holocaust survivors, writes short stories, often surreal and absurdist, that deal with the paradoxes of modern Israeli society; Kashu'a, an Israeli Arab who grew up in the Israeli educational system, writes books and humorous columns in the Hebrew language in which he addresses the problems faced by Arabs in Israel. Shortly after Kashu'a and his family left Israel following a politically charged summer, the two writers began a lively correspondence chronicling their innermost thoughts and trepidations. In this class students will delve into the writers correspondence (which was translated into English and published in the New York Times), explore selective works from both authors, watch films and TV series they have created (such as Keret's movie Jellyfish and Kashu'a's TV series \"Arab Labor\") as well as discuss their other visual works.",

    "overview": "Threesomes. Squirting. Vibrators. Butt plugs. Multiple orgasms. You may have seen them in pornography, but have you ever wanted to study and talk about sex, and specifically, how to have a satisfying sex life? Many people look to pornography not just for entertainment, but also for education about what satisfying sexual encounters look like. Unfortunately, much of what people learn from pornography doesn't lead them to healthy and satisfying sexual encounters and relationships. This lecture class isn't actually about pornography. It goes beyond many presumptions about sex and pleasure depicted in pornography, the media, and popular culture, in order to equip students with information that can lead to more satisfying and healthy sexual experiences across their lifespan, regardless of how they identify, or who or what they like. The course also familiarizes students with a wide spectrum of human identities, practices, and attitudes towards sex and sexuality. The course includes lectures from guest speakers with particular expertise or experience in topics covered. Possible topics covered include: physiological and biological sex; gender; sexual orientation; homophobia and heterosexism; navigating sexual risks in a sex-positive way; sexual health disparities; sexual desire, arousal, and response; solitary sex \u0026 sex with others; sex toys; unconventional sexual practices; intimacy and effective communication; sexuality \u0026 aging; sexuality, disability \u0026 intimacy; sexual problems and solutions; sexual harassment and violence; selling sex; and hallmarks of great relationships; race, gender \u0026 sexuality, and yes, dotted through the quarter are some references to pornography.",

Students will engage with a variety of materials, including historical studies and narratives, ethnographic texts, nonfiction essays, short stories, visual art, and popular culture. Our objective is to question common assumptions about how individuals and communities experience growing up and growing old. Discussions will highlight political and economic dimensions that affect life trajectories within communities, as well as how other categories of social difference inform ideas about age and age relations.",

    "overview": "This course in Foucauldian and contemporary post-Foucauldian biopolitics offers an introduction to the field organized by the themes of biopower, resistance, necropolitics, and thanatopolitics. In this context, to think with the interrelations of race, gender, sexuality, class, poverty, health, citizenship, immigration status, abilities, and nationalist exceptionalism, is also to consider the intersections of heterogeneous techniques of power. We'll consider engagements with and challenges to the Foucauldian lexicon of power (including the terms: sovereign, discipline, pastoral, governmental, biopolitical, security, neoliberal governmentality) that have been contributed by post-Foucauldian analyses whose lexicon also includes: domination, exploitation, occupation, expropriation, coloniality, and decoloniality, and which has asked how contemporary forms of resistance to power have centered around such as problems as: the formation of a sovereign right to maim; of freedom as burdened individuality; of neoliberalism as am omnipresent form of governmentality; the making of endebted life, and the deadly aspects of biopower.",

What are the political possibilities for reimagining the boundaries of queerness in the present? And what are the ongoing tensions and fault lines around identity and desire that remain unaddressed through queer theory's political interventions? These are some of the questions we will grapple with in this course. Screenings will include early gay and lesbian cinema, and \"queer\" film avant la lettre, the New Queer Cinema movement in the United States and Europe, as well as contemporary queer and trans film and video from around the world. We will pay particular attention to the aesthetic strategies of independent filmmakers and video artists, drawing out the connections between experimental aesthetic forms and politically engaged critique. Each week, we will develop a shared language of film analysis to address the intersections of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality through close readings of the visual texts.",

    "overview": "The Science Behind Oppression: Biased interpretations of scientific results have been used to justify racial and gender oppression for centuries. It was often argued that people of different races and different genders were fundamentally different, and as such their roles in society should differ as well. Today, many people reject the claim that race and gender have substantial effect on a person\\'s abilities or capacity, but how did we get here? More importantly, how did science help facilitate these claims in the first place?\n\nIn this course, we will explore the role of science in historical oppression based on race and gender. We will identify key scientific studies and their subsequent legacy to reveal the precarious nature of scientific interpretation in the hands of biased individuals. We will discuss how power structures can infiltrate scientific integrity and propose safeguards to prevent this kind of infiltration in the future.",

This course will examine the diverse ways in which humans use cultural resources to cope with pain, illness, suffering and healing in diverse cultural contexts. In addition, we will analyze various kinds of medical practices as cultural systems, examining how disease, health, body, and mind are socially constructed, how these constructions articulate with human biology, and vice versa. The course will provide an introduction to the major theoretical frameworks that guide anthropological approaches to studying human health-related behavior. Theory will be combined with case studies from a number of societies, from India, Japan, Brazil, and Haiti to the U.S. and Canada, enabling students to identify similarities across seemingly disparate cultural systems, while at the same time demonstrating the ways in which American health behaviors and practices are socially embedded and culturally specific. The course will emphasize the overall social, political, and economic contexts in which health behavior and health systems are shaped, and within which they must be understood.",

Using Turkey as the class's main case study but also discussing intersections between popular music and nationalism from Mexico and the United States to Greece, Brazil, and beyond, we will also explore issues like globalization, cultural flows, gender, queerness, and social movements related to music. The class will follow the major turning points of Turkey's history (the westernization movements of the late Ottoman Empire, the establishment of the Turkish Republic, military coups and other crises, social and everyday transformations) through its important musicians, genres, and scenes. While studying specific musical trends (like rock 'n' roll, for example) and their social/historical underpinnings, the class will provide students with broader methodologies and theories for using popular culture and music in the study of history.",

    "overview": "This course explores the complex social and cultural dynamics between ordinary Jews and Arabs in Palestine/The Land of Israel from the late 19th century to 1948. Moving beyond the conventional narrative of rivalry, violence, and conflict, we adopt a Relational History approach to uncover a richer and more nuanced understanding of this contested period. Focusing on interactions that extended beyond political tensions, we will examine shared identities, joint experiences, and daily encounters that shaped relations between Arabs and Jews. Topics include collaborations in mixed cities, the education system, business and labor markets, political organizations, leisure venues, and more. We will also delve into communal, personal and, at times, even romantic relationships that developed amidst the growing national struggle. Using primary historical sources, this course invites students to critically analyze how Jews and Arabs navigated their everyday lives in diverse public spheres, shedding light on an often-overlooked dimension of their shared history.",

    "overview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "overview": "Course title: Nomads in World History\n\nIn contrast to prevailing stereotypes of nomads as improvised, marginal wanderers or their romanticized depiction as exemplifying a simpler way of life, pastoral nomadic societies had a decisive role in shaping global history. From the late second millennium BCE to the eighteenth century CE, pastoral nomads emerged, often from the fringes of Eurasian civilizations, and wielding substantial military force influenced sedentary states, empires, and societies, from China to the Middle East and Europe. Beyond their military prowess, however, they also functioned as cultural agents. Sedentary people - Chinese, European, Muslim or others - portrayed them as violent intruders negatively impacting their cultures; yet nomads also facilitated and directed the exchange of goods, people, animals, religions, ideas, and technologies across civilizational boundaries, and maintained a relationship of interdependence with their settled neighbors. This course offers a comparative perspective on the role nomadic societies had in world history, spanning the early nomadic empire of the Xiongnu in nowadays Mongolia, Chinggis Khan's universal empire, the Berber Arabs of North Africa, and the Turkish armies in Asia Minor. We will explore how modern historians navigate the paucity of sources about nomads and the polities they established, and untangle narratives predominantly crafted by members of the sedentary societies.",

The topic of international law is a place to study the interaction of material, power and normative forces, and a place where one can employ all of the newest methods and approaches in political science. The new international law scholarship is being built in an unusually interdisciplinary fashion. We will be reading work that builds on economic theories, sociological theories, and traditional international relations approaches. We will also be examining questions of broad interest within political science and sociology-- the social construction and influence of norms in international affairs, the importance of murky issues like legitimacy and fairness in shaping public perceptions and actor behavior, and how institutions of international law including international treaties and international courts implicitly and explicitly shape the international political process and state behavior.",

    "overview": "The Cuban Revolution Through the Looking Glass\n\nIn 1959, the island nation of Cuba shocked the world when a popular uprising overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista and established a socialist state lead by Fidel Castro. The Cuban Revolution was a divisive event; even as left-leaning political groups around the world heralded it as the dawn of a new world order, thousands of Cubans fled the island, many for the United States. In the more than six decades since 1959, the Revolution and its enigmatic leader(s) have been the subject of inspiration, imitation, and intense debate. And no one has been more involved in these \"Cuban Memory Wars,\" as historian Michael Bustamante has termed them, than Cubans themselves, both those on the island and those in the diaspora. In this course, we will look at how the Cuban Revolution has been portrayed and understood in Cuban literary and cultural production on both sides of the Florida Strait. In this journey, we will read a diverse array of texts produced in both Spanish and English - political speeches, films, short stories, scholarly essays, novels, memoirs and videos - in an attempt to understand how writers and artists in Cuba as well as Cubans and Cuban Americans in the U.S. have addressed questions of political engagement, national identity, the place of art in political revolution, and the challenges Cuba has faced in the post-Soviet era. Prerequisite: SPANISH 250-0, SPANISH 251-0, SPANISH 260-0, or SPANISH 261-0, OR by permission of the instructor.",

    "overview": "Societies forge the objects they value most. Despite this, scholarship on forgery tends to be a footnote to the histories of art and archaeology. This seminar puts forgery at the centre of history as a window onto the cultures, political economy and geography of knowledge of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Students will use a broad range of primary sources, including court records, forgers' diaries, intelligence files, novels and expert reports, to explore the historical detective stories of frauds such as the evolutionary \"missing link\" of Piltdown Man, the tomb of the last Aztec emperor, the Hitler diaries and the masterly pre-Hispanic epic of the Codex Cardona. These detailed case studies of archaeological, artistic and paleontological fraud are juxtaposed with social histories to investigate why people go to immense trouble to make fakes; why other people buy them; and what their efforts tell us about societies ranging from late Imperial China to post-revolutionary Mexico.",

We will explore the context and cause of crises such as Dutch Tulipomania in the 1630s, the Australian gold rush in the 1850s, and the global Great Depression of the 1930s. In addition, we will explore how contemporaries understood these crises as symptomatic of the social failings of their time. We will compare both the nature of the failures and the social responses to the failure over time, and develop critical contrasts as well as comparisons to crises in our contemporary moment. Themes we will explore throughout the course include the relationship between morality/religion and the economy, the role of the state as regulator, imperialism and distance, and the role of emotions in the market economy.",

    "overview": "The racialization of Indigenous polities in North America has been a key mechanism for undermining Indigenous sovereignty and facilitating settler colonialism. In analytically foregrounding Indigenous sovereignty, this course examines how race has been imposed upon Indigenous peoples and nations so settlers could dispossess them of their lands and their political authority over those lands. Through this course, we will consider how US anthropology contributed to the development of the notion of indigeneity-as-race in North America, the function of Indigenous racialization, and how Indigenous communities have grappled with their racialization throughout time and into the present.",

Throughout the quarter, class meetings will be devoted to grammar review and completing Chapters 34-40 of Wheelock's Latin. Students will also read extensive selections from the Letters of Pliny the Younger. Students will be expected to develop reading, translation, and literary analysis skills in prepared passages from the original Latin text.",

An emphasis on practical real-world scenarios (case studies) that provide us guidance in making better socially conscience decisions will be made. The course can be viewed primarily as being concerned with the philosophy of chemistry as dictated by our modern world in the 21st Century.",

    "overview": "This course tracks problems of knowledge and truth in modernity. If the \"moderns\" defined themselves by their rejection of \"ancient\" dogmas, their use of new \"rational\" methods of inquiry, and their acquisition of truth through the free circulation of information, contemporary politics is marked—so we are told—by a resurgence of myth and irrationalism, ironically through the very forms of free exchange that were supposed to liberate humanity from its \"self-imposed immaturity.\"\n\nSo what happened? Has the modern project of truth-seeking failed? Was it overthrown, or dismembered by the forces it unleashed? Did it run aground against certain inherent features of politics? Or is modernity alive and kicking, albeit in different shoes? In \"Modernity and Its Discontents,\" we will attempt to get to grips with these and other questions through a plethora of \"modern\" (and in some cases, \"pre-modern\" and \"post-modern\") perspectives on the relation of truth and politics. How does \"truth\" make itself felt in politics? What political status should attach to the possession of knowledge? Who is authorized to tell truths in political life, and what does this truth-telling look like? And what should we make of truth's various absences, including silence, ignorance, distortion, lying, and bullshit?",

Quality data visualizations have the power to help analysts better understand and effectively communicate their work. Students will learn how to construct quality data visualizations using RStudio. The course will address visualizing data of various forms (e.g. panel, spatial, temporal, etc.) and from various statistical domains such as inferential, descriptive, and predictive statistics. The course will focus on principles and techniques used to create static visualizations. The course will also provide an introduction to interactive visualizations and dashboards. These skills will be developed through project/lab-based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). A significant proportion of the course will be dedicated to a large-scale project.",

    "overview": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners or resources. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce inequities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and planetary health. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and equitable access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19.",

This is neither a course on the current issues in the world economy, nor a course on foreign economies. This course deals with conceptual problems that arise from the fact that countries interact with others through international trade. Although I discuss some current issues and historical episodes, I do so only to motivate conceptual problems I am introducing.",

It wasn't until I discovered statistics that I started to love numbers. Math is too often taught as though the mysteries of the universe were discovered long ago.  In contrast, statistics is one large puzzle, an ever moving and changing enigma with no \"right\" or \"wrong\".  There is no single way to solve this puzzle - and each method has unique strengths and weaknesses.  Thus, the greatest scientists are those with the greatest imagination.   This class is not your usual statistics course.  Instead of presenting statistics beginning with the math, we begin with the mystery, learning the math along the way - not as the ultimate goal, but as a guidepost for unlocking life's unending hidden questions."

    "overview": "\"Indigeneity and Settler Colonialism\"\n\nIn this seminar, we examine settler colonialism as a political, social, cultural and economic formation, as well as Indigenous social thought, resistance, resilience, and resurgence, focusing on the U.S. in historical, comparative, and global perspective. Settler colonialism is a distinctive form of social organization.  As Glenn (2015) has argued: \"The settler goal of seizing and establishing property rights over land and resources required the removal of indigenes, which was accomplished by various forms of direct and indirect violence, including militarized genocide.\"  This description is both accurate, and inadequate as it relates to the social construction of settler states.\n\nThis course engages with social theories of inequality, power, and difference, incorporating the Indigenous experience within U.S. settler colonialism.  Topics covered include: indigenous perspectives on time, place, power, and knowledge; groups and tribalism; colonization and settler colonialism; the entanglements of social science with settler systems; property, dispossession, and capitalism; biopolitics, gender, and reproduction.",

In addition, we will take up questions that have formed the core of Black study in the 20th century including 1) How do Black people \"theorize\" in their everyday life and cultural production (Christian 1987); 2) What cultural forms emerge to respond to and undermine antiblackness  (Carpio 2008; Scott 2022); 3) What role does literature play in the relation of Black feeling and the creation of Black life worlds (Hurston 1928; Lorde 1978; Quashie 2022; Nash 2024). Throughout, we will be especially attentive to how gender and sexuality work in tandem with race to contribute to the emotional lifeworlds of Black people.",

How can evolutionary psychology explain why we find certain features beautiful? Where does evolutionary theory fail in terms of predicting perceptions of beauty? Is beauty really in the eye of the beholder? How are gender roles and sexual orientation related to beauty and its pursuit? How do racism and classism shape our beauty ideals and ideas? Why is beauty associated with femininity? What cultural biases help those perceived as beautiful and hurt those perceived as lacking in beauty? Are beautiful people happier or more successful? How do cultural standards of beauty affect disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and body dysmorphic disorder?",

We will study writings from philosophers such as Bernard Williams, Martha Nussbaum, John McDowell, and Iris Murdoch, investigating their critiques of utilitarian and deontological theories and their attempts to develop alternative frameworks for thinking about morality. Through these readings, we will explore the ways in which this recent tradition can offer us new insights into the nature and complexity of ethical life.",

Throughout the course, we will read texts from both central, canonical writers and more marginal, contemporary ones. Additionally, we will examine aspects of gender, sexuality, and ethnicity in Hebrew literature. Ultimately, this course will allow students to discover the beauty and richness of modern Hebrew literature. The literary works will be accompanied by films, academic articles, and theoretical texts. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel, or Judaism is required! All the Hebrew texts will be read in translation.",

We will discuss the institutions of the American system, the nature of individual participation in the political process, and the interactions among citizens, elected officials, and other political actors and organizations (e.g., the media, political parties, and interest groups). Our approach to these topics will be theoretical and analytical: we will investigate the reasons why it is organized as it is and why it has changed over time, how individuals develop their political attitudes and patterns of behavior, and how the actions of both elites and the mass public combine to shape public policy outcomes.",

    "overview": "Legal St 394-LK-20 \"American Lawyering: Education and Practice\", Seth Meyer (Spring 2024) Attorneys are central to American life and popular culture, but the profession is undergoing dramatic change. For years, the supply of lawyers has vastly outstripped the demand for legal jobs and the resulting lawyer bubble has grown. Meanwhile, those who land law jobs have different challenges: recent surveys report many attorneys' growing disenchantment with their work and dissatisfaction with their lives. This seminar will examine the profession's multidimensional crisis. What changes occur in attorneys, both individually and systemically, emerging from law schools and finding their roles in the legal realm? Why is working within the most lucrative big firms now regarded by many as the pinnacle of private practice? What other options are available? It will explore life after law school, examining the disparate places law graduates might find themselves. The course invites prospective law students to consider their potential places, as individual lawyers, in what remains a noble profession. It also invites those students in other undergraduate disciplines who may be curious about trajectories open to them in this post-graduate academic and, ultimately, career field.",

    "overview": "This course takes stock of Black politics in the U.S. in the decades since the Civil Rights Movement. We will explore Blacks' ongoing and still fitful quest for racial equality and democratic responsiveness. Our review will pay close attention to the internal dynamics of Black politics. As we chart Blacks' political gains and setbacks, we will focus on class, gender, and other cleavages in the population to see how different groups have fared. We also will examine Blacks' fraught relations with whites, their engagement with mainstream political institutions, and their efforts to secure their rights and advance their interests from within and outside these institutions at the national and local level. The course materials cover a mix of topics that have occupied students of race and American politics since the Civil Rights Movement. These include: ongoing intergroup conflict and prejudice; segregation; social provision and criminal justice policies; systemic anti-Black racism in law enforcement; racial dynamics in voting and access to the ballot; partisan politics; and Blacks' electoral fortunes, including the election of the country's first Black president and the ensuing political developments. The overarching goal of the course is to shed light on the state of American democracy by studying the contemporary political experiences of Blacks.",

Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, practices and forms of knowledge production characteristic of what we call \"global health\" today, and explores the environmental, social, political and economic factors that shape patterns and experiences of illness and healthcare across societies. We will scrutinize the value systems that underpin specific paradigms in the policy and science of global health and place present-day developments in historical perspective. We will focus on social determinants of health, settler colonialism, colonialism, health and human rights, global health ethics, ecological determinants of health, and an overview of public health disciplines.",

    "overview": "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is not new. Long before the term was coined in 1955, engineers and inventors sought to mechanize human thought and behavior. This course will address and contextualize the chronological arc of AI, from eighteenth-century automatons to today's large language models. Together, we will investigate how changing conceptions of human intelligence and creativity influenced the development and implementation of what we now call AI. In so doing, we will familiarize ourselves with changing strategies for creating \"intelligent\" machines and engage in lively debates over the problems and possibilities of machine sentience. Will this course secure you a six-figure salary working for OpenAI? Sadly, no. It will, however, enrich your knowledge of the historical trajectory, evolving ethics, and critical concepts of AI.",

We will pay attention to what is considered \"literature\" by reading, listening, and watching materials that include: historical and religious documents, legal texts, poetry, historical documents, dramatic narratives, and artistic practices. This focus on genre will be used to articulate the tensions and contradictions of this historical era. Key themes of this course includes: identity, indigeneity, the formation of republics, language, race and ethnicity, colonialism, migration, and gender. The primary language of the class will be Spanish. I will do my best to consider the linguistic diversity of the region by including translations of works alongside the original texts in Indigenous and European languages.

Key course questions include: What can we learn from the aesthetic and communicative strategies that these digital performances animated, linking personal experience and social engagement? In what ways do these performances connect with and might help us navigate today's context of (dis)information overload, polarization, and affective volatility? How have these performances critically expanded the field of digital performance studies, redefining what liveness is and does? Students will read scholarship on liveness and digital mediation, analyze networked performances of their choosing, and produce critical essays or curated performance collections using multimodal publishing platforms. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically analyze and assess digital artistic and social performances and apply digital literacy skills learned in hands-on sessions to present their research findings.",

    "overview": "This is an introductory course that covers the fundamentals of microeconomics. We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

    "overview": "The racialization of Indigenous polities in North America has been a key mechanism for undermining Indigenous sovereignty and facilitating settler colonialism. In analytically foregrounding Indigenous sovereignty, this course examines how race has been imposed upon Indigenous peoples and nations so settlers could dispossess them of their lands and their political authority over those lands. Through this course, we will consider how US anthropology contributed to the development of the notion of indigeneity-as-race in North America, the function of Indigenous racialization, and how Indigenous communities have grappled with their racialization throughout time and into the present.",

This course will introduce more machine learning models (SVMs, MARs, ensembles, etc), deepen predictive modeling skills (feature engineering, model assessment and evaluation, etc), and survey topics such as unsupervised learning methods and natural language processing. While many data science problems will require knowledge of multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R through the IDE RStudio to conduct data science. Students will develop and extend skills, tools, and strategies for modeling and understanding complex data. These skills will be developed through project/lab-based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). This course dedicates a significant portion of time to a few culminating experiences, one of which is a final project.",

    "overview": "Hostage taking is a global, costly, and complex problem for domestic and international politics. Throughout history and around the world, perpetrators from the smallest gangs to the most powerful empires have taken humans captive for leverage. In this first-year writing seminar, students will explore contemporary and historical hostage crises to grapple with the intractable dilemmas of hostage politics: What makes someone a hostage? How does media coverage affect hostage situations? Should governments make concessions to bring hostages home? To explore these dilemmas and delve into real-world hostage crises, students will read scholarship and commentary, watch films, and hear from former hostages, advocates, and the government officials who specialize in hostage recovery. As a writing seminar, the course will prioritize the process and purpose of writing. Using the dilemmas of hostage politics, students will practice asking important questions, making compelling arguments, marshalling and organizing relevant evidence, and developing their own distinct writing style. Please note that the subject matter of this course entails depictions and discussions of violence.",

    "overview": "This course aims to give students grounding in postcolonial and decolonial translation studies by focusing on some of the problems embedded in its history and practice: translation's employment in the contexts of war, displacement, and empire; its role in national canon formation and transnational literary circulation amid the hegemonic force of Anglicization; and the importance of translation problems —mistranslation, pseudo-translation, \"bad translation,\" and untranslatability—to projects that we might organize under the sign of  \"solidarity.\" We try to account for translation's politics and ethics, that is. We will do so by focusing on important examples of translation theory as well as by using case studies drawn from the history of Arabic-English and Arabic-French translation from the 19th to the 21st century (using work from Algerian, Iraqi, Syrian, and Palestinian authors) and by class visits—funding pending—from working translators. Readings will be provided in English. No knowledge of a foreign language is required, but students with reading knowledge of Arabic or French are particularly welcome. We will work collaboratively and creatively with all of our competencies to further the course goals.",

These questions will drive our exploration into how the body is constructed, mediated, and negotiated through the critical lenses of race, gender, and sexuality across diverse contexts. As an inherently interdisciplinary course, we will draw from performance studies, literature, visual arts, gender and sexuality studies, critical race studies, and philosophy to gain a comprehensive understanding of the processes and ideologies that assign varied meanings and values to bodies. We will engage and dialogue with a wide range of knowledge productions encompassing performance, film, photography, novels, personal essays, and hybrid literary forms to develop a critical understanding of how the body is in a state of continuous formation. By putting these varied forms of intellectual thought into conversation with one another, we can discern the body as an archive and a site of resistance. This will lead us to a nuanced understanding of embodiment and embodied knowledge, challenging the traditional duality of mind and body.",

    "overview": "This course explores the complex relationship between illegal drugs and politics, asking how drug production, distribution, and consumption shape political institutions, violence, governance, and policy responses at local, national, and international levels. With a primary focus on North, Central, and South America, we will examine both theoretical and empirical perspectives on these connections. The course is structured into three parts. We begin with an overview of drug markets, defining key terms, identifying types of drugs, and tracing the historical development of drug production, transportation, and consumption patterns, especially in the Americas. Next, we investigate how illicit drug economies influence political life, focusing on patterns of drug-related violence, the role of drug trafficking groups as de facto rulers in local communities, and the factors that drive participation in illicit drug markets. In the final section, we assess drug policies, beginning with the U.S.-led \"war on drugs\" before exploring alternative approaches, including decriminalization and legalization",

In this course, we will survey Rawls's own work, alongside that of some of his most influential and incisive critics, such as Robert Nozick, Susan Moller Okin, G.A. Cohen, Jurgen Habermas, and Charles Mills. Topics to be studied include the contractualist method in political philosophy and the challenges of ideal theory, Rawls's theory of distributive justice and the value of equality, the problem of political stability, the idea of public reason, and more.",

    "overview": "How do we \"capture\" nonhuman phenomena within literary forms and genres that are designed (mainly) by humans? As an introduction to critical methods in textual studies, our seminar will think about how representation works across species and how it can grasp the relationship between animate creatures and their elemental surroundings. These habitats will range from literal fields, forests, skies, and oceans to the wily conceptual terrain of \"Nature\" itself. By focusing on human representations of animals and the nonhuman more broadly, this seminar delves into the question of how literary re-presentations of the natural world work - this is both a practical and a philosophical question. To address it, we'll analyze the raw materials and core resources of the written word: close observation and description; perspective, point-of-view, and matters of voice; anthropomorphizing and/or animalizing imagery; and the mind-bendingly disparate frameworks of narrative, human, evolutionary, and planetary time. In return, our readings will also trouble assumptions about how exclusively \"human\" we humans ever really are when we write.\n\nOur syllabus will include classics of nature writing and environmental literature, even as we push the boundaries of what is \"literary\" in the first place. With various contextualizing materials (from Aesop's fables to poetry to legal verdicts) provided by the instructor, our main texts will be selected from the following major works: Shakespeare's As You Like It and A Midsummer Night's Dream; Michel de Montaigne's Essays; sections of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man; Henry David Thoreau's \"Walking\" and \"Wild Apples\"; Octavia Hill's \"Open Spaces\"; Virginia Woolf's Flush: A Biography; Rachel Carson's \"The Road of the Hawks\" and Under the Sea-Wind; J.R. Ackerley's My Dog Tulip; Donna Haraway's The Companion Species Manifesto and Staying with the Trouble; Derek Jarman's Modern Nature; Sy Montgomery's The Soul of an Octopus; and Helen MacDonald's H is for Hawk.",

    "overview": "The Nazis veiled the Holocaust in a fog of secrecy and deception in their efforts to disguise their crimes and erase the voices of their victims. In response, Holocaust victims, both at the time and since, have struggled to tell their stories to the outside world. Paradoxically, the iconic genocide of the modern age that silenced millions of the murdered, and destroyed all trace of many of them, has also bequeathed to posterity the largest number of first-person testimonies about any single historical event. In this course we will examine a range of firsthand accounts of the Holocaust from the period itself and the subsequent decades. We will read selections from diaries, letters, memoirs, graphic novels, and courtroom testimony. We will discuss accounts left behind by victims, perpetrators, and so-called bystanders. Finally, we will work with the USC Shoah Visual Archive, the largest single collection of video interviews of genocide victims in existence. Throughout the course we will explore why the authors of these statements chose to testify and what we can (and cannot) learn from their testimony.",

What does it mean for a person when their most salient identity is that they are against the law, outside the law, or illegible under the law? How does it structure how they live their lives? Who gets to tell their stories? In this course, we examine personal and social scientific writings of three groups: over-policed Black Americans, undocumented immigrants, and transgender children. Through these writings, we will explore the relationships between law and stigma, surveillance, and recognition. The primary objective for this first-year seminar is to develop your ability to produce evidence-supported and effectively-organized academic writing.

We will then focus on the operations of the Supreme Court including justice selection and confirmation, judicial philosophies, agenda setting through case selection, and oral arguments. Finally, we will turn to the Supreme Court's influence on contemporary policy issues as well as its relationship to public opinion and ideas for reform. Readings in this course will include a mix of textbook chapters, academic articles, and news media that will focus on both foundational knowledge about the Supreme Court and analysis of its role in the U.S. political system.",

Sometimes cyberspace is depicted as a continuation of previous media such as television, cinema or telephone, but often it is envisioned as a new frontier. This course will examine the ways in which virtual media appears in cultural discourses. We consider how technological objects and tools participate in shaping elements of our culture that may appear natural, logical, or timeless. We will look examine films predicting the internet, cyberpunk fiction predating the www, and early websites from many sources. In addition, this quarter we will consider various generative AI programs, assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Our guiding questions will include the following: In what ways are these narratives shaping collective perceptions of the internet? How have virtual technologies challenged experiences of language, gender, community and identity? Following a Cultural Studies model for inquiry, this course will be project-based and experiential. Your attendance and participation are mandatory. No experience needed, only a willingness to take risks and share work.",

    "overview": "This is a class on the history and politics of antisemitism in modern Europe and the United States and how this phenomenon co-articulates with the rise of Zionism as a nationalist movement in the 19th century. This is a class on the rise of an idea and the movement which sought to implement it. And the relationship of this movement to religion, culture, global politics, and the existence of a pre-existing population. While this is not explicitly a course on the current situation in the Middle East (though obviously these are intimately related), it is an effort to provide a rigorous analysis of the political background for a very complicated and often violent conflict.",

We will frequently refer to important historical and current events as examples and applications of the theories and concepts taught in this course, so if you do not already have your favorite source of news or history, now is a good time to find one. Newspapers including The Economist, BBC World News, The Wall Street Journal, NYTimes, Washington Post, or Foreign Policy all have pretty good coverage of international affairs, but any favorite news source, or two, will do.",

    "overview": "Indo-Persian poetry was present at the very birth of the concept of \"world literature\": indeed, the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (d. 1832) coined the term Weltliteratur in part thanks to his admiration for the Persian poet Hafez Shirazi (d. 1390). Of course today the Persian language — or \"Farsi,\" as it is also known — is most commonly associated with the nation-state of Iran. But the historical association with world literature reveals a forgotten cosmopolitanism. Before the nineteenth century, Persian served for nearly a millennium as the literary and political lingua francaacross virtually the entire eastern Islamic world, including vast stretches of South, Central, and West Asia.  This course will introduce students to some of the most common genres of Indo-Persian literature, such as the romantic epic (masnavi), the courtly panegyric (qasida), the quatrain (ruba‘i) and especially the lyric (ghazal), as well as to some of the canonical poets of the era and the historical context in which they lived and wrote.  Expressions of love, longing, devotion, and dissent against religious orthodoxy were among the most common themes of this literature, giving rise to its many modern afterlives — for example, in Urdu and Turkish literature, but also in European Romantic poetry, American Transcendentalist philosophy, and the music of Bollywood cinema, to name just a few.  \n \nAll readings will be in English or in English translation, so no prior knowledge of Persian is required for this course; but students who do have some familiarity with Persian, or with related languages like Urdu, Turkish, or Arabic, are of course most welcome to read texts in the original languages if they so desire. Class time will be a mix of lectures that situate our literary readings in their global historical context, with time also set aside for discussing the literature itself, issues of translation, and scholarly debates about \"world literature\" itself as an analytical category.",

    "overview": "This class will trace the surprising proliferation of plots that lead to marriage in prose fictional forms before the consolidation of the modern realist novel.  (Spoiler alert:  not all of these plots end in marriage!)  Jane Austen's chaste representations of courtship were preceded by over 100 years of far less polite renditions of desire, economic need, frustration, rebellion, and amorous failure.  Due to women's historical exclusion from independent paid labor, girls were expected to turn into women who became wives.  This social expectation was interrogated, re-imagined, and subverted in new ways across the developing form(s) of prose fiction in Britain in the \"long\" eighteenth century (roughly 1660 - 1820).  As we will see, the marriage plot ascribed to Austen was far from the norm in the pre-realist novel:  we'll encounter extra-marital sexual autonomy, sapphic desire, incest, sex work, delusion, discipline, remarriage, and many other plot twists which show that the literary-historical road to the courtship plot was rocky, contested, and definitely not predictable.\n\nBefore Jane Austen means that we will not be reading Austen!  Prepare yourself for novels you will like just as much, or even better.",

    "overview": "The growth of the Latino population has transformed the United States and has led to heightened debates about their political power, cultural influence, citizenship, civil rights, and ethnic and racial categorization. Yet as the 2020 election demonstrated, many Americans still don't really understand who Latinos are—or who Latinos have been, and will become. While the increased attention to Latinos may feel \"new,\" Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of Latinos in the United States—and, indeed, across the Americas—from the 16th century through the early 21st century. In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses on race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community—or several communities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans, and others—that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture, and economy of the United States. Although we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations. Ultimately, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories.",

    "overview": "This course offers a deeper examination of a rapidly growing topic in environmental ethics and politics: environmental (in)justice. Together, we will critically reflect upon the questions that have shaped the contemporary discourse on environmental (in)justice. Some of the key questions that will be considered include: Is environmental injustice best understood through the lens of distributive justice alone, or must we take into account procedural justice as well? How does environmental justice relate to the values and ideals of other, more traditional forms of environmentalism? What, in turn, is its relationship—if any—to racism and other social justice issues, such as sexism and ableism? Moreover, what constitutes an environmental burden or benefit, and what is the appropriate standard for assessing ‘environmental risks' or forms of ‘exposure'? In the final section of the course, we will also reflect on how disagreement between stakeholders' moral and cultural standpoints complicates both the recognition and reparation of environmental injustices.",

Topics include investments in education and health, saving and lending behavior, microfinance, insurance, gender, migration, political economy, foreign aid, and more. We will investigate questions regarding the effects of underdevelopment across the world, with a particular focus on interventions that improve the lives of the poor. In doing so, we will apply both theoretical models and empirical tools used to study important policy questions related to poverty, inequality, and development.",

This course will introduce more machine learning models (SVMs, MARs, ensembles, etc), deepen predictive modeling skills (feature engineering, model assessment and evaluation, etc), and survey topics such as unsupervised learning methods and natural language processing. While many data science problems will require knowledge of multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R through the IDE RStudio to conduct data science. Students will develop and extend skills, tools, and strategies for modeling and understanding complex data. These skills will be developed through project/lab-based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). This course dedicates a significant portion of time to a few culminating experiences, one of which is a final project.",

The course introduces students to the sociological analysis of gender as a central component of social organization and social inequality in the US context.  We start by reviewing key sociological concepts that are important to the study of gender.  Next, we explore the causes and consequences of gender inequalities in important social institutions such as the family, the education system, and the labor market. We conclude by considering gender inequality in an international comparative context to understand crosscutting similarities and differences between the US and both high- and low-income contexts.  This allows us to explore the role social norms and policies play in perpetuating and/or mitigating gender inequalities.",

We will begin by focusing on the case of Italy, which has often been described as the \"political laboratory\" of the old continent, if not of the West at large. Our working thesis is that the massive convergence of economic and political interests in the careers of Silvio Berlusconi and Donald Trump, both business tycoons turned political leaders, cannot be properly understood without attending to issues of gender and sexuality. We will then expand our inquiry to the case of the United States and, in particular, to the role that intersectionality (here as in Italy) plays in our understanding of both past predicaments and future possibilities.",

    "overview": "\"Just Friends?\" Understanding Same-Sex Sexuality Before the Invention of Homosexuality\n\nSince Victor Hugo published his 1834 novella Claude Gueux, there has been much debate about the exact nature of the relationship between the two main characters, whether it was sexual and romantic or the two were just friends. Contemporary critics have tended either to project modern homosexual identity back onto the text or categorically deny that Hugo could have spoken about same-sex sexuality in the supposedly repressive atmosphere of the 19th century. In this course, we will take Claude Gueux as a case study and ask how we might reconstruct how a reader in 1834 might have understood what Hugo meant when he said that two prisoners were \"friends,\" and reconfigure the sexual categories that were operative before the invention of homosexuality. We will read a range of literary and other published texts from the July Monarchy that discuss criminal and prisoner intimacies. We will also analyze how 19th-century criminal and prisoner intimacy has been understood over time through its representations in the 20th and 21st centuries. Students will learn both the particularities of this particular case and be trained in a methodology for reconstructing the discursive field of a historical utterance that they may apply to their own areas of research.",

    "overview": "Modern art and architecture confront us with ruptures—of traditions, histories, landscapes, identities, bodies, and systems of power—forcing us to grapple with the violence and disorientations that define modernity. In the process, cultural producers have often turned toward the conventions of horror not only to make sense of modern existence but also to provoke radical reimaginings of the world. \n\nThis seminar explores examples from global modern and contemporary art and architecture that seek to provoke visceral responses from their audiences. The course is organized historically and thematically, engaging topics such as colonialism, war, revolution, and catastrophe. Students will endeavor to define the genre of horror and to identify its key devices, such as the uncanny, grotesque, abject, and dystopic. While we will learn from examples across art and architectural history, we will focus on works within the Block Museum of Art and other collections across campus, such as the Michael McDowell Death Collection. We will consider a variety of cultural objects, including painting, photography, film, architecture, and urban planning. As we do, we will also think about questions of reception and exhibition—what it means to look at, process, and be affected by the horrific. The seminar will culminate in an online exhibition of objects from the Block's collection on the subject of horror and art. Throughout the course, we will draw on decolonial, media, and spatial theories to deepen our understanding of how strategies of horror and dread are called upon to unsettle dominant perceptions.",

This course develops several models that explain long and short run behavior of the macroeconomy and its sub-parts. These include output, interest and inflation rates, labor and financial markets, government and international balance. Students will be expected to understand how the interaction of the goods market and the money/asset markets can lead to possible multiple equilibria in macroeconomics, how the economy can get stuck in bad ones, and how fiscal and monetary policies may make matters better...or worse. Students will understand the measurement of price level changes, labor market variables, productivity, and the macroeconomic imbalances that can exist with the government budget and for assets and trade flows between nations in world markets. Students will understand the monetary and financial systems and how they contributed to our current situation, both in the US and Europe. Students will also understand the determinants of long run economic growth, and the resulting implications.",

It is designed to give students an exciting and stimulating understanding of the biology and ecology of all plants, while at the same time not overwhelming students with levels of detail and specialized terminology that are not useful to non-majors. We will learn how plants make food, move around to new places, reproduce, deal with extreme weather, and defend themselves against natural enemies. We will investigate the partnerships plants form with other groups of organisms, such as those with animal pollinators, fungi, and animal body guards. We will consider how plant form and function relates to global biodiversity patterns and contributes to the healthy functioning of ecosystems everywhere. Finally, throughout all of these topics, we will consider how humans use plants as sources of food, fiber, shelter, medicines, drugs, and more.",

The class will put an emphasis on applied microeconomic theory and empirical analysis. For each topic, we will study concrete examples emanating from all over the world, and make an intensive use of statistics.

Experience gained in this course will assist students interested in the characterization, assessment, and management of field sites for environmental or economic purposes. This class will be divided into two sections of four weeks each:\n\n· Section one: will have an actual field trip and data sampling section, and will be focused on:\n\no preparing and setting up an environmental sampling plan\n\no perform in situ topographic observations and surveys as well as field sampling activities using rapid field test kits (like water, soil, air, etc.) or more advanced sampling tools\n\no data management, data analysis and Geostatistical Interpolation focused on project goals\n\n· Section two: will be focused on\n\no Geostatistical interpolations and data analyses focused on project goals.\n\nMastery of material presented in this course will benefit those seeking advanced academic degrees in science or engineering disciplines that involve subsurface characterization and modeling as well as students seeking professional employment in applied geology or environmental science. Site assessment involves both qualitative and quantitative analyses: development of conceptual site models requires imagination and experience; quantification of site characteristics requires the design of sampling strategies and application of statistical analyses. The objective of this course is to prepare students to do both by applying concepts and methods introduced in lecture through a series of homework assignments and a comprehensive term project.",

    "overview": "When I was an undergraduate student my \"To Be Read\" list was always really long and often forgotten. As I have re-established my love of reading for fun I see how literary genres influence and challenge our understanding of well-being/health. Fiction, non-fiction, poems, memoirs, novels, young adult fiction, science fiction, mysteries, fantasy, fairy tales, horror, magical realism, and so many other genres influence our definitions of health or wellbeing. They provide insight into how other folks imagine and understanding situations we may or may not find ourselves in. Our course will consider some of these and other genres noted above. The best text allow us to empathize with the characters or challenge what we thought we knew. We will read one book as a class. In addition, you'll be asked to individually select a book to read/listen to, a list of various text will also be provided if you need guidance in choosing a text. You will learn how these materials influence or challenge norms about health and well-being. Professor Reyes will help you access books that aren't easily available or affordable.",

    "overview": "By any metric, thousands of natural languages are used across the globe. But languages don't differ arbitrarily; instead, at each level of analysis, there seem to be a number of identifiable patterns across languages, even across languages unrelated to each other. Linguistic typology is the discipline that systematically compares languages on the basis of their structural features, aiming to classify languages analytically rather than genealogically and to find universal patterns. This course covers typology and linguistic universals at the levels of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, paying special attention to developing students' skills at describing and categorizing the world's varied languages.",
